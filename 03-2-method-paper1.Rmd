## Impact on otitis media with treatment failure (Paper I){#paper1}

The objective of Paper I was to evaluate whether the introduction of PHiD-CV10 was associated with a reduction in the incidence of otitis media with treatment failure. 
Treatment of otitis media with ceftriaxone was used as a proxy for treatment failure.
Ceftriaxone use for other diagnoses and in older children was used as a comparator.

All children under 18 years of age who visited Children's Hospital Iceland between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015 were included.
Children's Hospital Iceland's referral area was defined as a 100 kilometer driving distance from the hospital.
Population demographic data for the referral area were obtained from Statistics Iceland (www.statice.is), as previously described in \@ref(statisticsiceland).

Data were extracted from Landspitali University Hospital's [patient registry](#patientregistry).
A visit was included in the study if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) was documented in the medical record, or if a child received one or more doses of ceftriaxone.
All administered doses of ceftriaxone were systematically extracted from the hospital's medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04.
The ICD-10 diagnoses associated with the ceftriaxone administrations were then obtained from the patient registry.
The total number of visits per calendar year and month regardless of diagnosis was provided by the hospital.

Pre-vaccine (2008-2011) and post-vaccine (2012-2015) periods were defined based on the year of vaccine introduction.
Because hospital visits for otitis media (OM) are uncommon in older children, the primary analysis was restricted to children under four years of age. 
Ceftriaxone use was analysed in three separate diagnostic groups; otitis media, pneumonia, and other, based on the associated ICD-10 diagnostic codes. 
Ceftriaxone was considered to be due to OM, if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) was recorded.
It was considered due to pneumonia if ICD-10 codes Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) or Pneumonia, unspecified organism (J18) was recorded.
Visits associated with ceftriaxone administration that did not fall into either of the above categories were classified together as "Other".

The number of ceftriaxone treatment episodes per diagnostic group was aggregated by calendar month.
An episode was considered distinct if no ceftriaxone administration was documented in the previous 14 days.
Incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-years were calculated by dividing the monthly number of ceftriaxone episodes per diagnostic group by the number of person-years accrued by children in the referral area.
The IR of OM visits were similarly defined and calculated.
If a decrease were to be observed in the number of ceftriaxone treated OM episodes, it could be due to either a decrease in the number of OM visits or a decrease in the use of ceftriaxone.
To evaluate this, the incidence risk of ceftriaxone treated OM episodes was calculated per 1,000 OM episodes presenting to Children's Hospital Iceland for both the pre- and post-vaccine periods. 

Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.4.4. [@R-base] using the epiR package [@R-epiR].
Incidence rate ratios ($IRR$) were calculated between the pre- and post-vaccine periods, and were estimated independently for each age-strata. 
The stratum-specific estimates were combined (when appropriate) using the Mantel-Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using the delta procedure [@Kirkwood2003].
The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the incidence rate ratio ($IRR_{MH}$) is the weighted mean of the $IRR$ in each stratum.
The null-hypothesis that $IRR_{MH} = 1$ was tested by calculating the Mantel-Haenszel $\chi^2$ test statistic, from which the *P*-value was derived.

Combining stratum-specific estimates is appropriate when the exposure-outcome association is the same in each of the strata, i.e. $IRR_{age} = IRR_{MH}$ 
The $\chi^2$ test of heterogeneity assesses whether the data is congruent with the null hypothesis which predicts no effect modification of the exposure-outcome relationship by strata.
The greater the differences is between $IRR_{age}$ and $IRR_{MH}$, the larger the $\chi^2$ statistic.
If the null hypothesis is rejected, the $IRR_{MH}$ is not calculated and only the stratum-specific $IRR$ are presented.
