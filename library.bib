abstract = {Invasive pneumococcal disease and antimicrobial (AM) resistance in pneumococci are important public health concerns. With the advent of new pneumococcal vaccines, information on serotype prevalence and their temporal fluctuations is important. Information on AM use and consent for participation was obtained by a questionnaire to parents of children at 5 day-care centres in Reykjavik from 1992 to 1999, and nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured selectively for pneumococci. The pneumococci were serotyped and pulsed field gel electrophoresis used to determine clonality. Of 1228 nasopharyngeal swabs, 640 (52.1{\%}) yielded pneumococci of which 89 (13.9{\%}) had decreased susceptibility to penicillin and 1 was resistant. Children receiving AMs during the month preceding nasopharyngeal sampling and children attending a day-care centre where AM use was high were significantly more likely to carry penicillin non-susceptible isolates. Serotypes 6A, 6B and 23F were most common (48{\%}), and 74{\%} of serotyped isolates belonged to 1 of the 7 most common serotypes. Almost all penicillin non-susceptible isolates were of serotype 6B or 19A. Serotype prevalence fluctuated markedly between y. In conclusion, there was significant variation in serotype prevalence between y, and only 51{\%} of the pneumococci belonged to serotypes covered by the current 7-valent conjugated vaccine.},

abstract = {In epidemiological studies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that utilize administrative data, cases are typically defined by the presence of a pneumonia hospital discharge diagnosis code. However, not all such hospitalizations represent true CAP cases. We identified 3991 hospitalizations during 1997-2005 in a managed care organization, and validated them as CAP or not by reviewing medical records. To improve the accuracy of CAP identification, classification algorithms that incorporated additional administrative information associated with the hospitalization were developed using the classification and regression tree analysis. We found that a pneumonia code designated as the primary discharge diagnosis and duration of hospital stay improved the classification of CAP hospitalizations. Compared to the commonly used method that is based on the presence of a primary discharge diagnosis code of pneumonia alone, these algorithms had higher sensitivity (81-98{\%}) and positive predictive values (82-84{\%}) with only modest decreases in specificity (48-82{\%}) and negative predictive values (75-90{\%}).},

abstract = {The laboratory diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) continues to rely on culture-based methods that have been used for many decades. The most significant recent developments have occurred with antigen detection assays, whereas the role of nucleic acid amplification tests has yet to be fully clarified. Despite developments in laboratory diagnostics, a microbiological diagnosis is still not made in most cases of IPD, particularly for pneumococcal pneumonia. The limitations of existing diagnostic tests impact the ability to obtain accurate IPD burden data and to assess the effectiveness of control measures, such as vaccination, in addition to the ability to diagnose IPD in individual patients. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for pneumococcal disease—especially tests that are suitable for use in underresourced countries.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common condition for which antibiotics are prescribed for US children; however, wide variation exists in diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review on AOM diagnosis, treatment, and the association of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) use with AOM microbiology. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Databases, and Web of Science, searched to identify articles published from January 1999 through July 2010. STUDY SELECTION: Diagnostic studies with a criterion standard, observational studies and randomized controlled trials comparing AOM microbiology with and without PCV7, and randomized controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent article review and study quality assessment by 2 investigators with consensus resolution of discrepancies. RESULTS: Of 8945 citations screened, 135 were included. Meta-analysis was performed for comparisons with 3 or more trials. Few studies examined diagnosis; otoscopic findings of tympanic membrane bulging (positive likelihood ratio, 51 [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, 36-73]) and redness (positive likelihood ratio, 8.4 [95{\%} CI, 7-11]) were associated with accurate diagnosis. In the few available studies, prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae decreased (eg, 33{\%}-48{\%} vs 23{\%}-31{\%} of AOM isolates), while that of Haemophilus influenzae increased (41{\%}-43{\%} vs 56{\%}-57{\%}) pre- vs post-PCV7. Short-term clinical success was higher for immediate use of ampicillin or amoxicillin vs placebo (73{\%} vs 60{\%}; pooled rate difference, 12{\%} [95{\%} CI, 5{\%}-18{\%}]; number needed to treat, 9 [95{\%} CI, 6-20]), while increasing the rate of rash or diarrhea by 3{\%} to 5{\%}. Two of 4 studies showed greater clinical success for immediate vs delayed antibiotics (95{\%} vs 80{\%}; rate difference, 15{\%} [95{\%} CI, 6{\%}-24{\%}] and 86{\%} vs 70{\%}; rate difference, 16{\%} [95{\%} CI, 6{\%}-26{\%}]). Data are absent on long-term effects on antimicrobial resistance. Meta-analyses in general showed no significant differences in antibiotic comparative effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Otoscopic findings are critical to accurate AOM diagnosis. AOM microbiology has changed with use of PCV7. Antibiotics are modestly more effective than no treatment but cause adverse effects in 4{\%} to 10{\%} of children. Most antibiotics have comparable clinical success.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine current rates of and trends in hospitalizations for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and CAP-associated complications among children. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional, retrospective, cohort study by using the 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database. National estimates for CAP and CAP-associated local and systemic complication rates were calculated for children {\textless} or =18 years of age. Patients with comorbid conditions or in-hospital birth status were excluded. Percentage changes were calculated by using 1997 (before heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV7]) and 2006 (after PCV7) data. RESULTS There were a total of 619,102 CAP discharges for 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006, after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall rates of CAP discharges did not change substantially between 1997 and 2006, but stratification according to age revealed a 22{\%} decrease for children {\textless}1 year of age, minimal change for children 1 to 5 years of age, and increases for children 6 to 12 years (22{\%}) and {\textgreater} or =13 years (41{\%}) of age. Systemic complication rates were highest among children {\textless}1 year of age but decreased by 36{\%}. In all other age groups, systemic complication rates remained stable. Local complication rates increased 78{\%} overall. Children 1 to 5 years of age had the highest local complication rates. CONCLUSIONS After the introduction of PCV7 in 2000, rates of CAP-associated systemic complications decreased only for children {\textless}1 year of age. Rates of pediatric CAP-associated local complications are increasing in all age groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced into the Norwegian Childhood Immunization Program in 2006. A substantial effectiveness of PCV7 immunization against invasive pneumococcal disease has been demonstrated, whereas evidence of its impact on respiratory tract infections are less consistent. METHODS: This study included children participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, which recruited pregnant women between 1999 and 2008. Maternal report of acute otitis media (AOM), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and asthma in the child was compared by PCV7 immunization status, as obtained from the Norwegian Immunization Registry. Generalized linear models with the log-link function were used to report adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: For children who had received 3 or more PCV7 immunizations by 12 months of age, the adjusted RRs of AOM and LRTIs between 12 and 18 months were 0.86 (95{\%} CI: 0.81, 0.91) and 0.78 (95{\%} CI: 0.70, 0.87) respectively, when compared with nonimmunized children. A reduced risk of AOM, RR 0.92 (95{\%} CI: 0.90, 0.94), and LRTIs, RR 0.75 (95{\%} CI: 0.71, 0.80), between 18 and 36 months of age was also identified among children who had received 3 or more immunizations by 18 months of age. No association was seen between PCV7 immunization and asthma at 36 months of age. CONCLUSION: Reduced incidences of AOM and LRTIs before 36 months of age were observed among children immunized with PCV7 through the childhood immunization program.},

Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis showed good correlation with ribotying. ETs and ribotypes among invasive and carriage isolates were similar. Within different S. pneumoniae serogroups/types, both clonal (7 and 14) and heterogenous (6, 19, and 23) ET and rRNA hybridization patterns were observed. Greatest diversity was observed among serotypes 6A, 6B, and 19F. Use of 12 additional restriction enzymes besides PvuII and BglII did not increase ribotype discrimination within serotype 7 and 14 isolates. Serotype 7 and 14 strains, which appear clonal by subtyping, are rare among carriers but common causes of invasive disease. Characteristics associated with their clonality may represent an advantage for invasiveness.},

abstract = {The Japanese guidelines for acute otitis media in children recommend classifying acute otitis media by age, manifestations and local findings, and also recommend myringotomy for moderate-grade cases with severe local findings, severe-grade cases, and treatment-resistant cases. The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was released in Japan in February 2010. In Hiroshima City, public funding allowing free inoculation with this vaccine was initiated from January 2011, and the number of vaccinated individuals has since increased dramatically. This study investigated changes in the number of myringotomies performed to treat acute otitis media during the 5-year period from January 2008 to December 2012 at two hospitals and five clinics in the Asa Area of Hiroshima City, Japan. A total of 3,165 myringotomies for acute otitis media were performed. The rate of procedures per child-year performed in {\textless}5-year-old children decreased by 29.1{\%} in 2011 and by 25.2{\%} in 2012 compared to the mean rate performed in the 3 years prior to the introduction of public funding. A total of 895 myringotomies were performed for 1-year-old infants. The rate of myringotomies per child-year performed for acute otitis media in 1-year-old infants decreased significantly in the 2 years after the introduction of public funding for heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared to all years before introduction (p{\textless}0.000001). Our results suggest a benefit of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for acute otitis media in reducing the financial burden of myringotomy. In addition, this vaccine may help prevent acute otitis media with severe middle ear inflammation in 1-year-old infants.},

Serotype- and serogroup-specific odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study and as a pooled estimate, with use of serotype 14 as the reference group. ORs varied widely: the serotypes with the highest ORs (1, 5, and 7) were 60-fold more invasive than those with the lowest ORs (3, 6A, and 15). There was a significant inverse correlation between invasive disease and carriage prevalence for the serotypes that we considered, which implies that the most invasive serotypes and serogroups were the least commonly carried and that the most frequently carried were the least likely to cause invasive disease. There was no evidence of any temporal change or major geographical differences in serotype- or serogroup-specific invasive disease potential.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED The aim of our study was to determine the burden of acute otitis media (AOM) on patients and their families. Parents of children with AOM were interviewed with regard to the week preceding the AOM diagnosis and every 3 days henceforth for an additional 21 days. The interview included information on loss of workdays, use of health care services and impact on the patient's and family's quality of life. Parents of age- and neighbourhood-matched controls were interviewed in an identical manner. A total of 150 patients and 51 controls were included in the analysis. The following variables differed significantly ( P{\textless}0.001) between patients and controls (mean +/- SD): non-routine days 18.5+/-11.0 in patients versus 3.4+/-6.5 in controls; number of visits to primary health centres 2.6+/-1.6 versus 0.4+/-0.6; number of emergency room visits 0.2+/-0.5 versus 0.1+/-0.02 and number of visits to an otolaryngology clinic 0.3+/-0.6 versus 0. Days of antibiotic and over the counter drug use were 9.0+/-5.6 versus 0.3+/- 0.9 and 7.0+/-6.0 versus 4.9+/-6.0, respectively per episode. The mean loss of workdays per child was 1.6+/-1.8 in patients versus 0.25+/-0.6 in controls, for working mothers and 0.6+/-1.1 versus 0.1+/-0.4 for working fathers; duration of absenteeism from day care facilities was 3.5+/-2.5 versus 0.9+/-2.7. CONCLUSION Acute otitis media significantly reduces the quality of life of both child and parents, causes substantial use of medical services and significant loss of workdays.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate antibiotic prescription for children in Emilia Romagna, a Northern Italian region with 414 880 people aged 1-14 years. METHODS: The regional Prescription Database of drugs reimbursed by the Italian National Health Service was used in this study. Antibiotic use was estimated as the proportion of children who received at least one prescription during the year 2000 (number of children treated per 100 inhabitants per year). To evaluate the frequency of exposure for each child, all the prescriptions given within a period shorter than 12 days were considered as a single treatment. RESULTS: In the year surveyed, 511,270 antibiotic prescriptions in 219,257 children were identified. In all, 52.9{\%} of children received at least one antibiotic; this percentage decreased with age, ranging from 70.4{\%} in children 1-2 years old to 35.8{\%} in children {\textgreater}11 years old. Fifty-two per cent of inhabitants under the age of 15 years were treated with systemic antibiotics at least once in the year. Cephalosporins were mostly prescribed in the youngest children, while macrolides were most frequently used in children over 6 years old. In all 3.9{\%} of children were treated with topical antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that paediatric antibiotic prescription rates can be derived from analysis of regional drug and resident databases. High antibiotic usage is shown in the paediatric population of Emilia Romagna, similar to that observed in other regions of Northern Italy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are predominantly prescribed. Comparison with prescription rates from other countries' paediatric populations suggests there is extensive antibiotic overuse in Italy. This could be associated with selection for and dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Interventions are needed to reduce consumption.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has reduced vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease but increases in non-vaccine-type (NVT) disease have varied between countries. We assess the effect of the PCV7 vaccination on VT and NVT disease in England and Wales. METHODS: The study cohort was the population of England and Wales from July, 2000, to June, 2010. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to compare incidences of VT and NVT disease before (2000-06) and after (2009-10) the introduction of PCV7. We used data from the national surveillance database. Cases included in our analysis were restricted to those confirmed by culture linked with isolates referred for serotyping at the national reference centre by laboratories in England and Wales. We adjusted for potential bias from missing data (serotype and age of patient) and changes in case ascertainment rates during the study period. FINDINGS: 5809 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were reported in 2009-10, giving an incidence of 10{\textperiodcentered}6 per 100,000 population in 2009-10, which, when compared with the adjusted average annual incidence of 16{\textperiodcentered}1 in 2000-06, gives an overall reduction of 34{\%} (95{\%} CI 28-39). VT disease decreased in all age groups, with reductions of 98{\%} in individuals younger than 2 years and 81{\%} in those aged 65 years or older. NVT disease increased by 68{\%} in individuals younger than 2 years and 48{\%} in those aged 65 years or older, giving an overall reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease of 56{\%} in those younger than 2 years and 19{\%} in those aged 65 years or older. After vaccine introduction, more NVT serotypes increased in frequency than decreased, which is consistent with vaccine-induced replacement. Key serotypes showing replacement were 7F, 19A, and 22F. Increases in NVT invasive pneumococcal disease were not associated with antimicrobial resistance. INTERPRETATION: Despite much serotype replacement, a substantial reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease in young children can be achieved with PCV7 vaccination, with some indirect benefit in older age groups. Further reductions should be achievable by use of higher valency vaccines. Robust surveillance data are needed to properly assess the epidemiological effect of multivalent pneumococcal disease vaccines. FUNDING: Health Protection Agency.},

abstract = {Background Since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, vaccine type pneumococcal carriage and disease has decreased world-wide. The aim was to monitor changes in the nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci, the distribution of serotypes and antimicrobial resistance in children before and after initiation of the 10-valent pneumococcal vaccination in 2011, in a previously unvaccinated population. Methods Repeated cross-sectional study at 15 day-care centres in greater Reykjavik area. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected yearly in March from 2009 to 2015. The swabs were selectively cultured for pneumococci, which were serotyped using latex agglutination and/or PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility determined. Two independent studies were conducted. In study 1, on total impact, isolates from children aged {\textless}4 years were included. The vaccine-eligible-cohort (birth-years: 2011–2013, sampled in 2013–2015) was compared with children at the same age born in 2005–2010 and sampled in 2009–2012. In study 2 on herd effect, isolates from older non-vaccine-eligible children (3.5–6.3 years) were compared for the periods before and after the vaccination (2009–2011 vs 2013–2015. Vaccine impact was determined using 1-odds-ratio. Results Following vaccination, the vaccine impact on vaccine type acquisition was 94{\%} (95{\%} CI: 91–96{\%}) in study 1 and 56{\%} (95{\%} CI: 44–65{\%}) in study 2. The impact on serotype 6 A was 33{\%} (95{\%} CI: −9{\%}; 59{\%}) in study 1 and 42{\%} (95{\%} CI: 10–63{\%}) in study 2 with minimal effect on 19A. The non-vaccine serotypes/groups 6C, 11, 15 and 23B were the most common serotypes/groups after vaccination. Isolates from the vaccine-eligible-cohort had lower penicillin MICs, less resistance to erythromycin and co-trimoxazole and less multi resistance than isolates from the control-group. Conclusions The efficacy of the vaccination on vaccine serotypes was high, and a milder effect on vaccine-associated-serotype 6A was observed for the vaccine-eligible-cohort. There was a significant herd effect on vaccine types in older non-vaccine-eligible children. Overall antimicrobial non-susceptibility was reduced.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adenoidectomy, surgical removal of the adenoids, is a common ENT operation worldwide in children with otitis media. A systematic review on the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in this specific group has not previously been performed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of adenoidectomy versus non-surgical management or tympanostomy tubes in children with otitis media. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 March 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing adenoidectomy, with or without tympanostomy tubes, versus non-surgical management or tympanostomy tubes only in children with otitis media. The primary outcome studied was the proportion of time with otitis media with effusion (OME). Secondary outcomes were mean number of episodes, mean number of days per episode and per year, and proportion of children with either acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME), as well as mean hearing level. Tertiary outcome measures included atrophy of the tympanic membrane, tympanosclerosis, retraction of the pars tensa and pars flaccid and cholesteatoma. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen randomised controlled trials (2712 children) studying the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with otitis media were evaluated. Most of these trials were too heterogeneous to pool in a meta-analysis. Loss to follow up varied from 0{\%} to 63{\%} after two years.Adenoidectomy in combination with a unilateral tympanostomy tube has a beneficial effect on the resolution of OME (risk difference (RD) 22{\%} (95{\%} CI 12{\%} to 32{\%}) and 29{\%} (95{\%} CI 19{\%} to 39{\%}) for the non-operated ear at six and 12 months, respectively (n = 3 trials)) and a very small ({\textless} 5 dB) effect on hearing, compared to a unilateral tympanostomy tube only. The results of studies of adenoidectomy with or without myringotomy versus non-surgical treatment or myringotomy only, and those of adenoidectomy in combination with bilateral tympanostomy tubes versus bilateral tympanostomy tubes only, also showed a small beneficial effect of adenoidectomy on the resolution of the effusion. The latter results could not be pooled due to large heterogeneity of the trials.Regarding AOM, the results of none of the trials including this outcome indicate a significant beneficial effect of adenoidectomy. The trials were too heterogeneous to pool in a meta-analysis.The effects of adenoidectomy on changes of the tympanic membrane or cholesteatoma have not been studied. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows a significant benefit of adenoidectomy as far as the resolution of middle ear effusion in children with OME is concerned. However, the benefit to hearing is small and the effects on changes in the tympanic membrane are unknown. The risks of operating should be weighed against these potential benefits.The absence of a significant benefit of adenoidectomy on AOM suggests that routine surgery for this indication is not warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2000, an outbreak of severe pneumonia caused by a virulent clone of serotype 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in the Nunavik region of Quebec. A mass immunization campaign was implemented in the spring of 2002, targeting persons ≥5 years of age and using the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). At the same time, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced into the routine immunization programme of infants, with catch-up for children up to 4 years of age.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in relation to PPSV23 and PCV7 use.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of IPD cases identified by the Quebec public health laboratory during the period 1997-2010.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 82 IPD cases were identified during the study period. In adults, serotype 1 incidence decreased following the 2002 PPSV23 mass campaign but breakthrough cases continued to occur. Following PCV7 use in children, there was a decrease in the incidence of vaccine-type IPD and replacement by other serotypes in adults. In children, a marked decrease in the annual incidence of serotypes included in PCV7 was observed following PCV7 introduction: 162/100,000 in 1997-2001 vs. 10/100,000 in 2004-2010 (p{\textless}0.01). Concomitantly, the incidence of IPD caused by serotypes not included in PCV7 increased from 29/100,000 to 109/100,000 (p=0.11).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The mass immunization campaign using the PPSV23 in 2002 and the introduction of PCV7 for the routine immunization of infants induced important modifications in the epidemiology of IPD. IPD rates in Nunavik remain much higher than in the southern part of the province both in children and adults. More effective pneumococcal vaccines are needed to eliminate geographic disparities in IPD risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The classification of pneumonia as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) has implications for selection of initial antimicrobial therapy. HCAP has been associated with an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and with high mortality leading to recommendations for broad empiric therapy. METHODS: We performed a prospective, population-based study on consecutive adults ({\textgreater}/= 18 years) admitted for pneumonia over 1 calendar year. Patients were classified by pneumonia type and severity. Microbial etiologic testing was performed on all patients. Treatment, length of stay, and mortality rates were compared. RESULTS: A total of 373 admissions were included, 94{\%} of all eligible patients. They were classified as CAP (n = 236, 63{\%}) or HCAP (n = 137, 37{\%}). Chronic underlying disease was more commonly found among patients with HCAP compared with CAP (74{\%} vs 51{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was more common among CAP patients (p {\textless} 0.01), while gram-negative bacteria were more often found among HCAP patients (p = 0.02). No MDR pathogens were detected, and rates of Staphylococcus aureus were similar in the two groups. HCAP patients were not more likely to receive ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy. HCAP patients had worse prognostic scores on admission and higher in-house mortality than CAP patients (10{\%} vs 1{\%}, respectively, p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even in a low resistance setting, patients with HCAP have increased mortality compared with patients with CAP. This is most likely explained by a higher prevalence of co-morbidities. Our data do not support broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy for HCAP.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely information about disease severity can be central to the detection and management of outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI), including influenza. We asked if two resources: 1) free text, and 2) structured data from an electronic medical record (EMR) could complement each other to identify patients with pneumonia, an ARI severity landmark.

METHODS: A manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits with associated chest imaging identified x-ray reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa score  = 0.88 (95{\%} CI 0.82∶0.93)), along with attendant cases with Possible Pneumonia (adds either cough, sputum, fever/chills/night sweats, dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain) or with Pneumonia-in-Plan (adds pneumonia stated as a likely diagnosis by the provider). The x-ray reports served as a reference to develop a text classifier using machine-learning software that did not require custom coding. To identify pneumonia cases, the classifier was combined with EMR-based structured data and with text analyses aimed at ARI symptoms in clinical notes.

RESULTS: 370 reference cases with Possible Pneumonia and 250 with Pneumonia-in-Plan were identified. The x-ray report text classifier increased the positive predictive value of otherwise identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms by 20-70{\%}, while retaining sensitivities of 58-75{\%}. These performance gains were independent of the case definitions and of whether patients were admitted to the hospital or sent home. Text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes did not add further value.

CONCLUSION: Specialized software development is not required for automated text analyses to help identify pneumonia patients. These results begin to map an efficient, replicable strategy through which EMR data can be used to stratify ARI severity.},

abstract = {Recent advances in hybridoma technology have allowed the development of homogeneous immunologic reagents of defined specificity, activity, and reproducibility. During the last few years, the number of monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria has increased exponentially, and research investigations have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibody technology offers a rapid, specific diagnosis of bacterial infection, long before culture results are available. We have described the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) infections in mothers and infants at risk to develop invasive GBS disease. Specifically, we have used the anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to detect GBS colonization, serotype bacterial isolates in the laboratory, and identify GBS antigens in body fluid specimens. We have also discussed the use of anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to confer protection against fatal infection in mice. Monoclonal antibodies against group A streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been developed with the potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious and often life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. With further refinements in monoclonal antibody technology in the future, streptococcal hybridomas may replace standard culture techniques for bacterial identification in the microbiology laboratory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nowadays, there are two vaccination strategies in Colombia to prevent pneumococcal diseases in people over 50 years. Our aim is to estimate cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13-valent (PCV13) versus pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23-valent (PPSV23) to prevent pneumococcal diseases and their related mortality in people over 50 years old in Colombia.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed with national data, including pneumococcal serotypes distribution in Colombia between 2005 and 2010. Vaccination of a cohort was simulated and a five year time horizon was assumed. Analysis was done from a perspective of a third party payer. Direct costs were provided by a national insurance company; sensitive univariate and probabilistic analysis were done for epidemiological and clinical effectiveness parameters and costs.

RESULTS: PCV13 avoids 3 560 deaths by pneumococcal infections versus PPSV23 and 4 255 deaths versus no vaccine. PCV13 prevents 79 633 cases by all-cause pneumonia versus PPSV23 and 81 468 cases versus no vaccine. Total costs (healthcare and vaccines costs) with PCV13 would be U.S. {\$} 97,587,113 cheaper than PPSV23 and it would save U.S. {\$} 145,196,578 versus no vaccine.

CONCLUSION: PCV13 would be a cost-saving strategy in the context of a mass vaccination program in Colombia to people over 50 years old because it would reduce burden of disease and specific mortality by pneumococcal diseases, besides, it saves money versus PPSV23.},

This multifactorial disease manifests as a spectrum of clinical syndromes from uncomplicated acute otitis media to more complex recurrent and chronic cases (frequently polymicrobial), with the major pathogens involved being Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) target only a few serotypes that cause otitis media; however, results from studies suggest that existing PCVs can prevent early episodes of disease associated with vaccine serotypes, resulting in a reduction of subsequent complex cases caused by non-vaccine serotypes and other otopathogens, which contribute considerably to the disease burden. In this Review, we discuss the role of pneumococcus in the disease continuum and assess clinical evidence showing the effect of prevention of early episodes on the complex interplay between bacterial species implicated in otitis media.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bronchiolitis is a major cause of infant morbidity and contributes to millions of dollars in health care costs. Care guidelines may cut costs by reducing unnecessary resource utilization. Through the implementation of a guideline, we sought to reduce unnecessary resource utilization and improve the value of care provided to infants with bronchiolitis in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time series that examined ED visits of 2929 patients with bronchiolitis, aged 1 to 12 months old, seen between November 2007 and April 2013. Outcomes were proportion having a chest radiograph (CXR), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) testing, albuterol or antibiotic administration, and the total cost of care. Balancing measures included admission rate, returns to the ED resulting in admission within 72 hours of discharge, and ED length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: There were no significant preexisting trends in the outcomes. After guideline implementation, there was an absolute reduction of 23{\%} in CXR (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 11{\%} to 34{\%}), 11{\%} in RSV testing (95{\%} CI: 6{\%} to 17{\%}), 7{\%} in albuterol use (95{\%} CI: 0.2{\%} to 13{\%}), and 41 minutes in ED LOS (95{\%} CI: 16 to 65 minutes). Mean cost per patient was reduced by {\$}197 (95{\%} CI: {\$}136 to {\$}259). Total cost savings was {\$}196,409 (95{\%} CI: {\$}135,592 to {\$}258,223) over the 2 bronchiolitis seasons after guideline implementation. There were no significant differences in antibiotic use, admission rates, or returns resulting in admission within 72 hours of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A bronchiolitis guideline was associated with reductions in CXR, RSV testing, albuterol use, ED LOS, and total costs in a pediatric ED.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pneumococcal diseases are major causes of morbidity among adults, especially those over 50years of age. While pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCV's) impact on pneumococcal disease rates among children is well established, the extent of its impact on adult pneumococcal related illness remains unclear. The aim of this systematic literature review was to describe the impact of PCV introduction to childhood national immunization programs worldwide on PCV-naive adult population. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed database. The search was limited to articles written in English and published between January 2000 and February 2016. Studies evaluating pneumococcal disease rates in individuals over 5years of age were included. Independent extraction of articles was performed by the two authors. Search terms included: Pneumococcal conjugated vaccine, herd, indirect, adults, and pneumonia. RESULTS Forty-nine articles meeting the selection criteria were identified, 39 regarding invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD, one on meningitis only), 8 regarding pneumonia, and 2 on both IPD and pneumonia. The majority of reports were from the US, UK and Canada. Considerable variability in the data sources, quality and completeness was observed. While most studies reported either statistically significant reduction or insignificant changes in IPD and pneumonia disease rates in adults following PCV nationwide implementation, few studies reported statistically significant increase in pneumococcal disease rates, these were mainly from countries with low PCV coverage rates and/or inadequate surveillance. CONCLUSION Invasive pneumococcal diseases and pneumonia rates among the adult population decreased in most countries following PCV introduction into the NIP. This indirect effect on older population seems to be dependent on PCV coverage rates and time from PCV nationwide implementation. Adults {\textgreater}65years old seem to benefit the most from PCV introduction.},

Data are presented by types of facilities, age and sex of the patients, and geographic regions. Major categories of procedures and diagnoses are shown by age and sex. Selected estimates are compared between 1996 and 2006. METHODS The estimates are based on data collected through the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The survey was conducted from 1994-1996 and again in 2006. Diagnoses and procedures presented are coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). RESULTS In 2006, an estimated 57.1 million surgical and nonsurgical procedures were performed during 34.7 million ambulatory surgery visits. Of the 34.7 million visits, 19.9 million occurred in hospitals and 14.9 million occurred in freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. The rate of visits to freestanding ambulatory surgery centers increased about 300 percent from 1996 to 2006, whereas the rate of visits to hospital-based surgery centers remained largely unchanged during that time period. Females had significantly more ambulatory surgery visits (20.0 million) than males (14.7 million), and a significantly higher rate of visits (132.0 per 1000 population) compared with males (100.4 per 1000 population). Average times for surgical visits were higher for ambulatory surgery visits to hospital-based ambulatory surgery centers than for visits to freestanding ambulatory surgery centers for the amount of time spent in the operating room (61.7 minutes compared with 43.2 minutes), the amount of time spent in surgery (34.2 minutes compared with 25.1 minutes), the amount of time spent in the postoperative recovery room (79.0 minutes compared with 53.1 minutes), and overall time (146.6 minutes compared with 97.7 minutes). Although the majority of visits had only one or two procedures performed (56.3 percent and 28.5 percent, respectively), 2.6 percent had five or more procedures performed. Frequently performed procedures on ambulatory surgery patients included endoscopy of large intestine (5.8 million), endoscopy of small intestine (3.5 million), extraction of lens (3.1 million), injection of agent into spinal canal (2.7 million), and insertion of prosthetic lens (2.6 million). The leading diagnoses at ambulatory surgery visits included cataract (3.0 million); benign neoplasms (2.0 million), malignant neoplasms (1.2 million), diseases of the esophagus (1.1 million), and diverticula of the intestine (1.1 million).},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Adenoidectomy at initial tympanostomy tube placement (TT) may reduce the rate of repeated surgery for otitis media. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of primary adenoidectomy as an adjuvant to TT (Ad + TT) compared with TT alone. DATA SOURCES PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched with no publication year restrictions beyond those of the individual databases. STUDY SELECTION Articles that compared outcomes of children having undergone primary Ad + TT with children having undergone TT alone for middle ear disease. DATA EXTRACTION Medical literature addressing Ad + TT was systematically reviewed. Data extracted included study design, age of children, and follow-up time frame. Level of evidence was assessed, and data were pooled where possible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of children requiring repeated TT (r-TT). Secondary outcomes included proportion of children with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), otorrhea, or any combination of the 3. RESULTS Fifteen articles met inclusion criteria. Ten studies (n = 71,353) reported that primary Ad + TT decreased the risk of r-TT or risk of RAOM, OME, or otorrhea compared with TT alone. Four studies (n = 538) reported no difference between Ad + TT groups compared with TT-only groups in the prevention of r-TT or of RAOM, OME, or otorrhea. Despite significant heterogeneity, limited meta-analysis and pooling of data revealed that the estimated rate of r-TT for children undergoing primary adenoidectomy was 17.2{\{}{\%}{\}} (95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI, 12.2{\{}{\%}{\}}-22.2{\{}{\%}{\}}) vs 31.8{\{}{\%}{\}} (95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI, 23.9{\{}{\%}{\}}-39.8{\{}{\%}{\}}) for children undergoing primary TT only. When stratified by age younger than 4 years, the protective effects of adenoidectomy were diminished. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The current evidence suggests that primary Ad + TT may be superior to TT only in decreasing the risk of r-TT and the risk of RAOM, OME, or otorrhea. Limitations include heterogeneity of the source data, with the predominance of retrospective data as well as studies with older children supporting the superiority of adjuvant adenoidectomy. The practice of Ad + TT may decrease the risk of repeated surgery in children older than 4 years.},

Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease vaccine trial was designed to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) against several outcomes. We now report results for pneumonia. METHODS In this nationwide, cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, children younger than 19 months received PHiD-CV10 in 52 clusters or hepatitis vaccines as control in 26 clusters. Infants younger than 7 months at the first vaccination received either 3+1 or 2+1 vaccination schedule, children aged 7–11 months received 2+1, and those 12–18 months of age two-dose schedule. All hospitalizations and outpatient visits to hospital associated with ICD-10 codes compatible with pneumonia were identified through the National Care Register and 1–3 frontal chest X-ray images per event were collected. External readers who were unaware of the patients' vaccination status retrospectively interpreted the images. The evaluated outcomes were hospital-diagnosed, hospital-treated pneumonia as primary diagnosis, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia during the blinded, intention-to-treat follow-up period from the first vaccination to the end of 2011. Total VE was calculated as 1 minus rate ratio of all pneumonia episodes. RESULTS 47 366 children were enrolled from February 2009, to October 2010. VE against all episodes of hospital-diagnosed pneumonia was 27{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 14{\%}, 38{\%}), 32{\%} (95{\%} CI: 3{\%}, 52{\%}), and 23{\%} (95{\%} CI: −5{\%}, 44{\%}) in subjects enrolled at age {\textless}7, 7–11, and 12–18 months, respectively. Corresponding rate reductions were 3.4, 4.7, and 2.5 per 1000 person-years. VE estimates against pneumonia with alveolar consolidation or pleural effusion (WHO criteria) in the three cohorts were 45{\%} (95{\%} CI: 26{\%}, 60{\%}), 56{\%} (95{\%} CI: 14{\%}, 77{\%}), and 48{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2{\%}, 73{\%}), respectively.

abstract = {This study examines the validity of using ICD-10 codes to identify hospitalized pneumonia cases. Using a case-cohort design, subjects were randomly selected from monthly cohorts of patients aged {\textgreater} or = 65 years discharged from April 2000 to March 2002 from two large tertiary Australian hospitals. Cases had ICD-10-AM codes J10-J18 (pneumonia); the cohort sample was randomly selected from all discharges, frequency matched to cases by month. Codes were validated against three comparators: medical record notation of pneumonia, chest radiograph (CXR) report and both. Notation of pneumonia was determined for 5098/5101 eligible patients, and CXR reports reviewed for 3349/3464 (97{\%}) patients with a CXR. Coding performed best against notation of pneumonia: kappa 0.95, sensitivity 97.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 97.1-98.3), specificity 96.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 96.2-97.5), positive predictive value (PPV) 96.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 95.4-97.0) and negative predictive value (NPV) 98.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 97.6-98.6). When medical record notation of pneumonia is used as the standard, ICD-10 codes are a valid method for retrospective ascertainment of hospitalized pneumonia cases and appear superior to use of complexes of symptoms and signs, or radiology reports.},

abstract = {Health services research conducted over the past 25 years makes a compelling case that having health insurance or using more medical care would improve the health of the uninsured. The literature's broad range of conditions, populations, and methods makes it difficult to derive a precise quantitative estimate of the effect of having health insurance on the uninsured's health. Some mortality studies imply that a 4{\%} to 5{\%} reduction in the uninsured's mortality is a lower bound; other studies suggest that the reductions could be as high as 20{\%} to 25{\%}. Although all of the studies reviewed suffer from methodological flaws of varying degrees, there is substantial qualitative consistency across studies of different medical conditions conducted at different times and using different data sets and statistical methods. Corroborating process studies find that the uninsured receive fewer preventive and diagnostic services, tend to be more severely ill when diagnosed, and receive less therapeutic care. Other literature suggests that improving health status from fair or poor to very good or excellent would increase both work effort and annual earnings by approximately 15{\%} to 20{\%}.},

abstract = {Quality problem: Inappropriate antibiotic use drives development of antimicrobial resistance. Worldwide, guideline adherence for antibiotic treatment of infectious disease is far from optimal. Insight in prescribing quality is pivotal for healthcare professionals and policy makers to intervene appropriately.Initial assessments: European countries uniformly monitor antibiotic use, which is reported yearly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Unfortunately, this has not had enough impact to decrease prescribing and resistance levels.Choice of solution: Quality indicators (QIs) could provide better insight in prescribing quality and enable benchmarking to other countries; this could trigger action to improve antimicrobial prescribing. European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) proposed 12 antibiotic QIs.Implementation: Trends in use of antibiotic subgroups and the 12 ESAC QI values were determined for Dutch primary care (2004-2013); outcomes were compared to other European countries. Dutch antibiotic use is low within the European context. Nitrofurantoin use is higher than the European average, use of small-spectrum antibiotics lowers. Use of macrolides, quinolones and amoxicillin/clavulanate declined, which was not supported by the broad/narrow QI results.Evaluation: QIs expressing antibiotic subgroup use in Defined Daily Doses/1000 inhabitants/day, particularly small-spectrum and non-first choices, provide proper insight in prescribing quality and are useful for benchmarking purposes. QIs measuring percentages were not considered useful. The broad/narrow ratio could be more informative when adjusted to national guidelines, or when more antibiotic subgroups are included based on better European consensus.Lessons learnt: Benchmarking the above mentioned Dutch QI values to other countries provides direction for three specific strategies to further improve Dutch antibiotic prescribing practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vaccine-serotype (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) rates declined substantially following introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into national immunization programs. Increases in non-vaccine-serotype (NVT) IPD rates occurred in some sites, presumably representing serotype replacement. We used a standardized approach to describe serotype-specific IPD changes among multiple sites after PCV7 introduction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Of 32 IPD surveillance datasets received, we identified 21 eligible databases with rate data ≥ 2 years before and ≥ 1 year after PCV7 introduction. Expected annual rates of IPD absent PCV7 introduction were estimated by extrapolation using either Poisson regression modeling of pre-PCV7 rates or averaging pre-PCV7 rates. To estimate whether changes in rates had occurred following PCV7 introduction, we calculated site specific rate ratios by dividing observed by expected IPD rates for each post-PCV7 year. We calculated summary rate ratios (RRs) using random effects meta-analysis. For children {\textless}5 years old, overall IPD decreased by year 1 post-PCV7 (RR 0.55, 95{\%} CI 0.46-0.65) and remained relatively stable through year 7 (RR 0.49, 95{\%} CI 0.35-0.68). Point estimates for VT IPD decreased annually through year 7 (RR 0.03, 95{\%} CI 0.01-0.10), while NVT IPD increased (year 7 RR 2.81, 95{\%} CI 2.12-3.71). Among adults, decreases in overall IPD also occurred but were smaller and more variable by site than among children. At year 7 after introduction, significant reductions were observed (18-49 year-olds [RR 0.52, 95{\%} CI 0.29-0.91], 50-64 year-olds [RR 0.84, 95{\%} CI 0.77-0.93], and ≥ 65 year-olds [RR 0.74, 95{\%} CI 0.58-0.95]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Consistent and significant decreases in both overall and VT IPD in children occurred quickly and were sustained for 7 years after PCV7 introduction, supporting use of PCVs. Increases in NVT IPD occurred in most sites, with variable magnitude. These findings may not represent the experience in low-income countries or the effects after introduction of higher valency PCVs. High-quality, population-based surveillance of serotype-specific IPD rates is needed to monitor vaccine impact as more countries, including low-income countries, introduce PCVs and as higher valency PCVs are used.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Antibiotic use is unnecessarily high for paediatric respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care, and implementation of treatment guidelines is difficult in practice. This study aims to assess guideline adherence to antibiotic prescribing for RTIs in children and examine potential variations across Dutch general practices. METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study, deriving data on diagnoses and prescriptions from the electronic health records-based NIVEL Primary Care Database. Patients {\textless}18 years of age with a diagnosis of fever, ear and respiratory infections (International Classification of Primary Care codes A03, H71, R72, R75, R76, R78 and R81) during 2010-12 were included. Antibiotics were linked to episodes of illness. Two types of disease-specific outcomes were used to assess adherence to national guidelines regarding antibiotic prescribing choices. Inter-practice variability in adherence was assessed with multilevel analysis. RESULTS Half of the episodes with RTIs with restrictive prescribing policy and 65{\%} of episodes with pneumonia were treated with antibiotics. General practitioners prescribed antibiotics for 40{\%} of episodes with bronchitis, even though guidelines discourage antibiotic prescribing. First-choice antibiotics were prescribed in 50{\%}-85{\%} of episodes with selected diseases, with lowest values for narrow-spectrum penicillins. Levels of adherence to guidelines varied widely between diagnoses and between practices. CONCLUSIONS Most paediatric RTIs in the Netherlands continue to be treated with antibiotics conservatively. Potential aspects of concern are the inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute bronchitis and the underuse of some first-choice antibiotics. Continuing progress may be achieved by targeting practices with lower adherence rates to guidelines.},

This study aims to appraise the 'value for money' of PCV-7 vaccination programme from the societal perspective and the budget impact from the perspective of municipalities, which is responsible for providing routine vaccination. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value of launching such programme with two levels of co-payment, ¥1000 (US{\$}13) or ¥0, and two scenarios of the uptake of vaccine (vaccinated-alone or co-vaccinated with other vaccines). We found that when vaccinated-alone, ICERs in QALY were ¥7,441,000 (US{\$}93,013) or ¥9,065,000 (US{\$}113,313), and when co-vaccinated ¥7,441,000 (US{\$}93,013) or ¥5,489,000 (US{\$}68,613), without or with productivity loss, respectively, regardless of co-payment level of the programme. Co-vaccinated programmes had lower ICER than vaccinated-alone programmes due to the savings in productivity loss. By adopting WHO's classification that an intervention is 'cost-effective' if ICER (in QALY) is between 1 and 3 times of GDP as a criterion, PCV-7 vaccination programme in Japan is concluded as "cost-effective" from the perspective of society. The introduction of either no co-payment or ¥1000 (US{\$}13) co-payment vaccination programme appears to be not budget saving for the first 6 years, whereas the level of budget impact are less than ¥11,000,000 (US{\$}137,500) or ¥8,500,000 (US{\$}106,250), respectively, for a municipality with 1000 birth cohort in the 1st year and 2nd to 5th year birth cohort proportional to the birth cohort population of estimated future population.},

abstract = {Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.},

They extend definitions of controlled direct effects and natural direct and indirect effects from the risk difference scale to the odds ratio scale. A simple technique to estimate direct and indirect effect odds ratios by combining logistic and linear regressions is described that applies when the outcome is rare and the mediator continuous. Further discussion is given as to how this mediation analysis technique can be extended to settings in which data come from a case-control study design. For the standard mediation analysis techniques used in the epidemiologic and social science literatures to be valid, an assumption of no interaction between the effects of the exposure and the mediator on the outcome is needed. The approach presented here, however, will apply even when there are interactions between the effect of the exposure and the mediator on the outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differences in pathogenicity between pneumococcal serotypes are important when assessing the potential benefit of different valency vaccines. We investigated the effect of serotype on clinical presentation, outcome, and quality of life lost from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the context of the 7, 10, and 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13). METHOD: Serotyped IPD cases in England were linked to the national dataset of hospital admissions for April 2002 to March 2011. Based on patients' diagnostic codes and vital status at the end of the admission, disease focus (meningitis, empyema, sepsis, or respiratory disease) and case fatality rates by serotype and age group (5, 5-64, and 65 years and over) were obtained. Using these data the quality adjusted life years (QALY) lost from the IPD remaining when use of PCV7 stopped in 2010 was estimated for the serotypes covered by higher valency vaccines. RESULTS: The linked dataset contained 23,688 cases with information on diagnosis, mortality, and serotype. There were significant differences between serotypes in the propensity to cause meningitis, death, and QALY loss in each of the investigated age groups. As a result, vaccines' coverage of disease burden differed by endpoint. For example, in children under 5 years in 2009/10, PCV10 covered 39{\%} of meningitis, 19{\%} of deaths and 28{\%} of the QALY loss of attributable to IPD, whereas the respective percentages for PCV13 were 65{\%}, 67{\%}, and 66{\%}. The highest QALY loss per serotype in this age group was for 6A. Non-PCV serotypes causing the highest QALY loss were 22F and 33F in {\textless}5 year olds and 31 in older individuals. CONCLUSION: Marked differences exist between serotypes in clinical presentation and outcome, and these should be considered when evaluating the potential impact of higher valency vaccines on overall disease burden and associated QALY loss.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE New vaccines that offer protection against otitis media caused by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and by Moraxella catarrhalis are under development. However, the potential health benefits and economic effects of such candidate vaccines have not been systematically assessed. METHODS We created a computerized model to compare the projected benefits and costs of (1) the currently available 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, (2) a candidate pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine that has been tested in Europe, (3) a hypothetical pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine, and (4) no vaccination. The clinical probabilities of acute otitis media and of otitis media with effusion were generated from multivariate analyses of data from 2 large health maintenance organizations and from the Pittsburgh Child Development/Otitis Media Study cohort. Other probabilities, costs, and quality-of-life values were derived from published and unpublished sources. The base-case analysis assumed vaccine dose costs of {\$}65 for the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, {\$}100 for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine, and {\$}125 for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine. RESULTS With no vaccination, we projected that 13.7 million episodes of acute otitis media would occur annually in US children aged 0 to 4 years, at an annual cost of {\$}3.8 billion. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was projected to prevent 878,000 acute otitis media episodes, or 6.4{\%} of those that would occur with no vaccination; the corresponding value for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine was 3.7 million (27{\%}) and for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine was 4.2 million (31{\%}). Using the base-case vaccine costs, pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine use would result in net savings compared with nontypeable 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate use. Conversely, pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine use would not result in savings compared with pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine use, but would cost {\$}48 000 more per quality-adjusted life-year saved. The results were sensitive to variations in assumptions on vaccine effectiveness and vaccine dose costs but not to variations in other assumptions. CONCLUSIONS New candidate vaccines against otitis media have the potential to prevent millions of disease episodes in the United States annually. If priced comparably with other recently introduced vaccines, these new otitis vaccines could achieve cost-effectiveness comparable with or more favorable than that of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common infectious disease in children. Data regarding the distribution of causative pathogens are not universal. Tympanic perforation due to AOM may occur in 5-30{\%} of AOM patients. The causative pathogens for AOM with tympanic perforation are limited. METHODS This was a prospective study conducted at the Department of Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. All consecutive children diagnosed as having AOM with tympanic perforation were enrolled. The age of the eligible patients was between 3 months and 5 years. Pus from the middle ear of each patient was swabbed and tested for culture/sensitivity. RESULTS There were 40 eligible patients diagnosed with AOM with tympanic perforation in this study. The mean age of all patients was 24.3 months and the patients were predominantly male (26 male; 65.0{\%}). None of these patients received S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae vaccination. All specimens were culture positive (100{\%}) and 13 organisms were identified. There were 53 identified pathogens; the most common pathogen was H. influenzae (19 times or 35.8{\%}), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14 times or 26.4{\%}). H. influenzae was 100{\%} sensitive to chloramphenicol, amoxicilllin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin, while S. aureus was also 100{\%} sensitive to oxacillin, vancomycin, and fusidic acid. CONCLUSIONS The two most common pathogens for AOM with tympanic perforation were H. influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Both pathogens were mostly sensitive to antibiotics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The GAVI Alliance supported 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) introduction in Kenya. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of introducing either PCV10 or the 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) from a societal perspective and explored the incremental impact of including indirect vaccine effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The costs and effects of pneumococcal vaccination among infants born in Kenya in 2010 were assessed using a decision analytic model comparing PCV10 or PCV13, in turn, with no vaccination. Direct vaccine effects were estimated as a reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. Pneumococcal disease incidence was extrapolated from a population-based hospital surveillance system in Kilifi and adjustments were made for variable access to care across Kenya. We used vaccine efficacy estimates from a trial in The Gambia and accounted for serotype distribution in Kilifi. We estimated indirect vaccine protection and serotype replacement by extrapolating from the USA. Multivariable sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. We assumed a vaccine price of US{\$} 3.50 per dose.\backslashn\backslashnFINDINGS: The annual cost of delivering PCV10 was approximately US{\$}14 million. We projected a 42.7{\%} reduction in pneumococcal disease episodes leading to a US{\$}1.97 million reduction in treatment costs and a 6.1{\%} reduction in childhood mortality annually. In the base case analysis, costs per discounted DALY and per death averted by PCV10, amounted to US{\$} 59 (95{\%} CI 26-103) and US{\$} 1,958 (95{\%} CI 866-3,425), respectively. PCV13 introduction improved the cost-effectiveness ratios by approximately 20{\%} and inclusion of indirect effects improved cost-effectiveness ratios by 43-56{\%}. The break-even prices for introduction of PCV10 and PCV13 are US{\$} 0.41 and 0.51, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Introducing either PCV10 or PCV13 in Kenya is highly cost-effective from a societal perspective. Indirect effects, if they occur, would significantly improve the cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined epidemiologic factors affecting mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia in 1995 through 1997. METHODS: Persons residing in a surveillance area who had community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from a sterile site were included in the analysis. Factors affecting mortality were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. The number of deaths from pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization in the United States in 1996 was estimated. RESULTS: Of 5837 cases, 12{\%} were fatal. Increased mortality was associated with older age, underlying disease. Asian race, and residence in Toronto/Peel, Ontario. When these factors were controlled for, increased mortality was not associated with resistance to penicillin or cefotaxime. However, when deaths during the first 4 hospital days were excluded, mortality was significantly associated with penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4.0 or higher and cefotaxime minimum inhibitory concentrations of 2.0 or higher. In 1996, about 7000 to 12,500 deaths occurred in the United States from pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and underlying disease remain the most important factors influencing death from pneumococcal pneumonia. Mortality was not elevated in most infections with beta-lactam-resistant pneumococci.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We used latent class analysis to identify subgroups with statistically distinct and clinically meaningful disease patterns in a nationally representative sample of Danish adults (N = 162,283) aged 16+ years. The analysis was based on 15 chronic diseases. RESULTS Seven classes with different disease patterns were identified: a class with no or only a single chronic condition (59{\%} of the population) labeled "1) Relatively Healthy" and six classes with a very high prevalence of multimorbidity labeled; "2) Hypertension" (14{\%}); "3) Musculoskeletal Disorders" (10{\%}); "4) Headache-Mental Disorders" (7{\%}); "5) Asthma-Allergy" (6{\%}); "6) Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders" (3{\%}); and "7) Complex Respiratory Disorders" (2{\%}). Female gender was associated with an increased likelihood of belonging to any of the six multimorbidity classes except for class 2 (Hypertension). Low educational attainment predicted membership of all of the multimorbidity classes except for class 5 (Asthma-Allergy). Marked differences in health-related quality of life between the seven latent classes were found. Poor health-related quality of life was highly associated with membership of class 6 (Complex Cardiometabolic Disorders) and class 7 (Complex Respiratory Disorders). Despite different disease patterns, these two classes had nearly identical profiles in relation to health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION The results clearly support that diseases tend to compound and interact, which suggests that a differentiated public health and treatment approach towards multimorbidity is needed.},

abstract = {Although there are many models which are used to calculate the health benefits (and thus the cost-effectiveness) of vaccination programmes, they can be divided into two groups: those which assume a constant force of infection, that is a constant per-susceptible rate of infection; and those which assume that the force of infection (at time t) is a function of the number of infectious individuals in the population at that time (dynamic models). In constant force of infection models the per-susceptible rate of infection is not altered, whereas in dynamic models mass immunization results in fewer infectious individuals in the community and thus a lower force of infection acting on those who were not immunized. We take an example of each of these types of model, examine their underlying assumptions and compare their predictions of the cost-effectiveness of a mass immunization programme against a hypothetical close contact infection, such as measles. We show that if cases of infection are the outcome of interest then the constant force of infection model will always underestimate the cost-effectiveness of the immunization programme except at the extremes when no one or everyone is immunized. However, unlike the constant force of infection model, the dynamic model predicts an increase in the average age at infection after immunization which could impact on the estimate of the cost-effectiveness of the programme if the risk of developing serious disease is a function of the age at infection (as, for instance, is the case for congenital rubella syndrome). Taking cases of infection as the outcome measure and using the dynamic model, the undiscounted cost-effectiveness ratio will tend to decline over time and approach a constant value, as the system moves from pre- to post-immunization equilibrium. We go on to show how the cost-effectiveness of a fixed-term immunization programme might change over time, and discuss why, under most circumstances, decision makers should not assume that elimination (permitting termination of mass immunization) will occur.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate and compare EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D) health states' values for pneumococcal and human papillomavirus (HPV) diseases in Argentina, Chile, and the United Kingdom.

METHODS: Twelve vignettes were designed, pilot-tested, and administered to a convenience sample in a cross-sectional design to elicit descriptive EQ-5D state data. Country-specific EQ-5D time-trade-off-based weights were used to map these descriptive health states into local country preference weights. Descriptive analysis is reported and intercountry differences for each condition were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance.

RESULTS: Seventy-three subjects completed the survey. Pneumococcal disease-related health states mean values ranged from -0.331 (sepsis, Chile) to 0.727 (auditive sequelae, Argentina). HPV-related conditions ranged from 0.152 (cervical cancer, United Kingdom) to 0.848 (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1, Argentina). Chile had consistently the lowest mean values in pneumococcal states and in one HPV state, whereas those of the United Kingdom were the lowest in most HPV states. Argentina had the highest mean values in both diseases. Differences in country-specific values for each health state were statistically (P {\textless} 0.001) significant except for six health states in which differences between Chilean and United Kingdom weights were nonsignificant.

CONCLUSIONS: Utility values for most conditions differed statistically relevantly among analyzed countries, even though the same health states' descriptive set was valued for each. These results reflect the difference in social weights among different countries, which could be attributed to either different population values or valuation study methodologies. They stress the importance of using local preference weights for context-specific decision making.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Otitis media with effusion (OME) can lead to significant hearing loss in children. Although previous studies have shown that bacterial DNA is present in a significant percentage of effusions sterile by culture, whether the DNA represents viable organisms or "fossilized remains" is unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine if bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA), as detected by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assay, is present in chronic pediatric middle ear effusions that contain bacterial DNA but are sterile by standard cultural methods. Bacterial mRNAs have a half-life measured in seconds to minutes; therefore, detection of bacteria-specific mRNAs would be evidence that metabolically active organisms are present. DESIGN Blinded comparative study. PATIENTS A total of 93 effusions from pediatric outpatients seen for myringotomy and tube placement for chronic ({\textgreater}3 months) OME (median age of children, 17 months). SETTING Tertiary care pediatric hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of positive test results for RT-PCR-based assays compared with culture for Haemophilus influenzae and concordance between RT-PCR and PCR-based findings for bacterial nucleic acids. RESULTS Eleven (11.8{\%}) of the 93 specimens tested positive by culture, PCR, and RT-PCR for H influenzae. A total of 29 specimens (31.2{\%}) were positive by PCR but negative by culture for H influenzae. All 29 specimens were positive by RT-PCR for H influenzae-specific mRNA. CONCLUSIONS The RT-PCR-based assay system can detect the presence of bacterial mRNA in a significant percentage of culturally sterile middle ear effusions, establishing the presence of viable, metabolically active, intact organisms in some culture-negative OME.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) causes a wide range of clinical manifestations that together constitute a major burden of disease worldwide. The main route of pneumococcal transmission is through asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharynx. Studies of transmission are currently of general interest because of the impact of the new conjugate-polysaccharide vaccines on nasopharyngeal colonisation (carriage). Here we report the first longitudinal study of pneumococcal carriage that records serotype specific exposure to pneumococci simultaneously within the two most important mixing groups, families and day care facilities. METHODS: We followed attendees (N = 59) with their family members (N = 117) and the employees (N = 37) in three Finnish day care centres for 9 months with monthly sampling of nasopharyngeal carriage. Pneumococci were cultured, identified and serotyped by standard methods. RESULTS: Children in day care constitute a core group of pneumococcal carriage: of the 36 acquisitions of carriage with documented exposure to homologous pneumococci, the attendee had been exposed in her/his day care centre in 35 cases and in the family in 9 cases. Day care children introduce pneumococci to the family: 66{\%} of acquisitions of a new serotype in a family were associated with simultaneous or previous carriage of the same type in the child attending day care. Consequently, pneumococcal transmission was found to take place as micro-epidemics driven by the day care centres. Each of the three day care centres was dominated by a serotype of its own, accounting for 100{\%} of the isolates of that serotype among all samples from the day care attendees. CONCLUSION: The transmission of pneumococci is more intense within than across clusters defined by day care facilities. The ensuing micro-epidemic behaviour enhances pneumococcal transmission.},

abstract = {To examine the relationship between adenoidectomy and repeat tympanostomy tube placement in the treatment of otitis media, and the relationship between potential risk factors for otitis media and repeat tympanostomy tube placement. Methods: Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of consecutive patients undergoing tympanostomy tube placement at an academic/teaching hospital with 400+ beds. Utilizing an electronic billing database, patients less than 18 years of age undergoing tympanostomy tube placement between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2007 were identified. Information regarding initial and repeat tympanostomy tube placement as well as potential risk factors for otitis media were extracted from medical records. Results: 904 children were included in the study. Of the 780 children who initially underwent tympanostomy tube placement alone, 178 required additional tube placement; a repeat rate of 20{\%}. Of the 90 children who initially underwent tympanostomy tube placement with adenoidectomy, only 6 required repeat tube placement, a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of repeat tympanostomy tube placement (95{\%} CI, 0.056-0.334; p{\textless} 0.0001). The presence of craniofacial anomalies and day care/school attendance were significantly associated with additional tube placement. Children between the ages of 4 and 10 showed a significant (p{\textless} 0.0001) decrease in the risk of repeat tube placement when an adenoidectomy was performed at the initial tube placement. Conclusion: Adenoidectomy performed at the first tympanostomy tube for the treatment of otitis media may decrease the risk of repeat tube placement, especially for children {\textgreater}4-10 years of age. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a major cause of treatment failure in children with acute otitis media (AOM). This study aimed to analyze the types of bacterial strains in fluid isolated from the middle ear of children with AOM who did not respond to oral antibiotic treatment. We also determined the antibiotic resistance of the most frequently isolated bacterial strain (Streptococcus pneumoniae) found in these children. METHODS This was a prospective study of 157 children with AOM aged from 6 months to 7 years admitted due to unsuccessful oral antibiotic treatment. All children underwent a myringotomy, and samples of the middle ear fluid were collected for bacteriological examination. RESULTS Positive bacterial cultures were obtained in 104 patients (66.2{\%}), with Streptococcus pneumoniae (39.69{\%}), Haemophilus influenzae (16.03{\%}) Staphylococcus aureus (16.03{\%}), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (6.9{\%}) and Streptococcus pyogenes (5.34{\%}) found most frequently. The majority (65.4{\%}) of S. pneumoniae strains were penicillin-intermediate-resistant or penicillin-resistant, and 67.2{\%} strains of S. pneumoniae were multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS We identified S. pneumoniae as the most frequently isolated pathogen from the middle ear in children with AOM treatment failure and determined that the majority of strains were antibiotic-resistant. We propose that the microbiological identification of bacterial strains and their degree of antibiotic resistance should be performed prior to therapy in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic therapy for children with AOM treatment failure.},

Microscopy of sputum is usually considered insensitive and poorly specific, and more invasively-obtained specimens are not routinely collected. Cultures of blood and respiratory secretions, and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and particle agglutination-based assays for capsular polysaccharides in serum and urine specimens, are specific but less than ideally sensitive. Some workers have reported specificity problems when immunoassays are applied to respiratory secretions. New diagnostic methods include detection of pneumococcal C polysaccharide in sputum and urine by ELISA and particle-agglutination assays, and these appear promisingly sensitive and specific in preliminary studies. Clinical assessments are now required to define the role of these techniques in guiding the treatment of individual patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading reason for hospitalization in children. The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in Taiwan in October 2005. There has been no comprehensive study of the etiology of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), either in the pre- or postpneumococcal conjugate vaccine era, in Taiwan.

METHODS: From August 2001 to July 2002, consecutive children admitted to a teaching hospital with radiologically confirmed CAP were prospectively enrolled. The following were considered indicative of infection when positive: blood or pleural effusion bacterial culture or urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test (Binax NOW), direct immunofluorescent antigen test for Chlamydia species and viruses, virus isolation and identification and viral, mycoplasmal or chlamydial serologic tests.

RESULTS: A total of 209 children were included, and 102 children (48.8{\%}) were male. Patients' ages ranged from 7 months to 16 years with a median of 4 years and 3 months. The combined tests identified at least 1 etiologic agent in 85.6{\%} of all cases, including typical bacterial pathogens in 88 cases (42.1{\%}; 86 S. pneumoniae, 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 77 cases (36.8{\%}), Chlamydia species in 24 cases (11.5{\%}), viral etiology in 86 cases (41.1{\%}) and mixed viral-bacterial infections in 69 cases (33{\%}). Children with S. pneumoniae infection were significantly younger than those with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (P = 0.0055) or unknown etiology (P = 0.0140).

CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and viruses were equally common etiologic agents of childhood CAP in Taiwan. Frequent coinfection increased the difficulty of both predicting the responsible organisms and choosing empiric antibiotics for the management of pediatric CAP.},

abstract = {Evaluating vaccine efficacy for protection against colonization with bacterial pathogens is an area of growing interest. Colonization of the nasopharynx is an asymptomatic carrier state responsible for person-to-person transmission. It differs from most clinical outcomes in that it is common, recurrent, and observed only in its prevalent state. To estimate rates of acquisition and clearance of colonization requires repeated active sampling of the same individuals over time, an expensive and invasive undertaking. Motivated by feasibility constraints in efficacy trials with colonization endpoints, investigators have been estimating vaccine efficacy from cross-sectional studies without principled methods. We present two examples of vaccine studies estimating vaccine efficacy from cross-sectional data on nasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). This study presents a framework for defining and estimating strain-specific and overall vaccine efficacy for susceptibility to acquisition of colonization (VE(acq)) when there is a large number of strains with mutual interactions and recurrent dynamics of colonization. We develop estimators based on one observation of the current status per study subject, evaluate their robustness, and re-analyze the two vaccine trials. Methodologically, the proposed estimators are closely related to case-control studies with prevalent cases, with appropriate consideration of the at-risk time in choosing the controls.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To compare the efficacy of three surgical treatment combinations – myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion (M{\&}T), adenoidectomy with M{\&}T (A-M{\&}T), and adenoidectomy with myringotomy (A-M) – in reducing middle-ear disease in young children with chronic OME. 

METHODS
Children 24–47 months of age, with a history of bilateral middle-ear effusion (MEE) for at least 3 months, unilateral for 6 months or longer or unilateral for 3 months after extrusion of a tympanostomy tube, unresponsive to recent antibiotic, were randomly assigned to either M{\&}T, A-M{\&}T, or A-M. Treatment assignment was stratified by age (24–35 months, 36–47 months), nasal obstruction (no, yes) and previous history of M{\&}T (no, yes). Subjects were followed monthly and with any signs or symptoms of ear disease for up to 36 months. 

RESULTS
Ninety-eight subjects were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups. Fifty-six subjects (57{\%}) were 24–35 months of age; 63{\%} had nasal obstruction, and 36{\%} had previously undergone M{\&}T. During the 36 months after entry, subjects were noted to have MEE for the following percentages of time: 18.6{\%} in the M{\&}T group, 20.6{\%} in the A-M{\&}T group, and 31.1{\%} in the A-M group (M{\&}T vs. A-M{\&}T, p=0.87; M{\&}T vs. A-M, p=0.01). By 36 months, there were no differences in the number of further surgical procedures for ear disease needed among the groups. 

CONCLUSIONS
Adenoidectomy with or without tube insertion provided no advantage to young children with chronic OME in regard to time with effusion compared to tube insertion alone. Fewer tympanostomy tubes were placed in children undergoing A-M as their initial procedure, but this should be balanced by the performance of the more invasive surgical procedure and their increased time with effusion.},

abstract = {? 2015 Springer-Verlag.Purpose: The study aims to analyse overall as well as subgroup-specific outpatient paediatric macrolide use in five European countries, including time trends of macrolide prescription rates, and to provide potential targets for future interventions aiming to promote judicious macrolide use. Methods: Macrolide prescription rates per 1000 person years to paediatric outpatients (?18 years) were calculated using healthcare databases from Denmark, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and the UK. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the influence of increasing calendar year on total macrolide and subgroup-specific prescription rates based on monthly data, adjusted for seasonal variations. Time periods for which data were available varied between 4 (Italy 2007-10, Germany 2005-8) and 10 years (UK 2000-9). Results: Paediatric macrolide use in 2008 varied between 199 (Italy) and 47 (Netherlands) prescriptions per 1000 person years. Prescription rates of short-acting macrolides declined significantly in all countries but the UK. The use of intermediate-acting macrolides significantly rose with increasing calendar year in Denmark (rate ratio (RR) = 1.12) and the UK (RR = 1.06), but decreased in Germany (RR = 0.84) and The Netherlands (RR = 0.97). Prescription rates of long-acting agents increased in Denmark (RR = 1.05), The Netherlands (RR = 1.05) and the UK (RR = 1.11) (all trends p {\textless} 0.05). The greatest seasonal variations of macrolide use between summer and winter months were observed in Italy and Germany. Conclusions: The observed trend toward increased prescribing of intermediate- and/or long-acting agents might further increase resistance pressure on bacterial pathogens due to their prolonged plasma half-life and broader antibacterial activity. Marked seasonality of prescription rates in the high-utilising countries, Italy and Germany, suggests frequent prescription of macrolides to treat respiratory infections which may be of viral origin.},

The rate of detection of pneumococcal antigens was thus greater with coagulation than with either of the other two methods. The differences were very significant (both P less than 0.01). Our study indicates that the advantages of coagglutination over the traditional bacteriological methods are its speed, sensitivity, convenience and also its relative independence of antibiotic therapy. It thus provides a new dimension in the aetiological diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia.},

abstract = {Mathematical models are developed to aid in the investigation of the implications of heterogeneity in contact with infection within a community, on the design of mass vaccination programmes for the control of childhood viral and bacterial infections in developed countries. Analyses are focused on age-dependency in the rate at which individuals acquire infection, the question of 'who acquires infection from whom', and the implications of genetic variability in susceptibility to infection. Throughout, theoretical predictions are based on parameter estimates obtained from epidemiological studies and are compared with observed temporal trends in disease incidence and age-stratified serological profiles. Analysis of case notification records and serological data suggest that the rate at which individuals acquire many common infections changes from medium to high and then to low levels in the infant, child and teenage plus adult age groups respectively. Such apparent age-dependency in attack rate acts to reduce slightly the predicted levels of herd immunity required for the eradication of infections such as measles, when compared with the predictions of models based on age-independent transmission. The action of maternally derived immunity in prohibiting vaccination in infants, and the broad span of age classes over which vaccination currently takes place in the U.K., however, argue that levels of herd immunity of between 90 and 94{\%} would be required to eliminate measles. Problems surrounding the interpretation of apparent age-related trends in the acquisition of infection and their relevance to the design of vaccination programmes, are discussed in relation to the possible role of genetically based variation in susceptibility to infection and observations on epidemics in 'virgin' populations. Heterogeneous mixing models provide predictions of changes in serology and disease incidence under the impact of mass vaccination which well mirror observed trends in England and Wales.},

abstract = {QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: Despite various efforts to estimate cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, only scarce information on the cost burden of paediatric community acquired pneumonia (CAP) exists. The objective of this study was to prospectively calculate direct and indirect costs associated with treatment of CAP from a society perspective in children between 2 months and 16 years of age seeking care at a tertiary hospital in Geneva, Switzerland between December 2008 and May 2010.

METHODS: This cost of illness study population comprised children aged from 2 months to 16 years of age seeking care for CAP at the University Children's Hospital Geneva from January 2008 through May 2010 (a subset of patients taken from a larger multicentre prospective cohort). Hospital-associated costs for episodes of pneumonia were computed according to the REKOLE{\textregistered} system. Non-hospital costs were estimated by parental interviews at baseline and follow-up on day 14.

RESULTS: The overall cost for one episode of CAP was 11'258 CHF; 23'872 CHF for inpatient treatment and 1009 CHF for outpatient treatment. Severe pneumonia cases per World Health Organisation (WHO) definition used significantly more hospital resources than non-severe cases: 21'842 CHF versus 3'479 CHF (p {\textless}0.0001).

CONCLUSION: Childhood CAP results in a significant medical cost burden that may have been underestimated in previous cost-effectiveness analyses of pneumococcal vaccine strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To aid decision making for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) use in infant national immunization programs, we summarized the indirect effects of PCV on clinical outcomes among nontargeted age groups. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the English literature on infant PCV dosing schedules published from 1994 to 2010 (with ad hoc addition of 2011 articles) for outcomes on children {\textgreater}5 years of age and adults including vaccine-type nasopharyngeal carriage (VT-NP), vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (VT-IPD) and syndromic pneumonia. RESULTS: Of 12,980 citations reviewed, we identified 21 VT-IPD, 6 VT-NP and 9 pneumonia studies. Of these 36, 21 (58{\%}) included 3 primary doses plus PCV or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) booster schedule (3+1 or 3+PPV23), 5 (14{\%}) 3+0, 9 (25{\%}) 2+1 and 1 (3{\%}) 2+0. Most (95{\%}) were PCV7 studies. Among observational VT-IPD studies, all schedules (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1) demonstrated reductions in incidence among young adult groups. Among syndromic pneumonia observational studies (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1), only 3+1 schedules showed significant indirect impact. Of 2 VT-NP controlled trials (3+0 and 3+1) and 3 VT-NP observational studies (2+1, 3+1 and 3+PPV23), 3+1 and 3+PPV23 schedules showed significant indirect effect. The 1 study to directly compare between schedules was a VT-NP study (2+0 vs. 2+1), which found no indirect effect on older siblings and parents of vaccinated children with either schedule. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect benefit of a 3+1 infant PCV dosing schedule has been demonstrated for VT-IPD, VT-NP and syndromic pneumonia; 2+1 and 3+0 schedules have demonstrated indirect effect only for VT-IPD. The choice of optimal infant PCV schedule is limited by data paucity on indirect effects, especially a lack of head-to-head studies and studies of PCV10 and PCV13.},

Data on VT insertions performed by any office-based practising ENT specialist in the region were collected from the National Health Service Registry. PARTICIPANTS All children below the age of 2 years with a first-time VT insertion from 2001 through 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Age-stratified and gender-stratified standardised incidence rates of first-time VT insertion, and incidence rate ratio for PCV period 2008-2011 compared with pre-PCV period 2001-2007. RESULTS The annual incidence rate of first-time VT insertion in small children increased steadily from 64/1000 person-years in 2001 to 100/1000 person-years in 2011. The incidence rate ratio was 1.27 (95{\%} CI 1.24 to 1.30) in the PCV period compared with the pre-PCV period. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of PCV into the Danish childhood immunisation programme in 2007 was not associated with a subsequent decrease in the rate of VT insertions among children below the age of 2 years. Instead, the rate continued to rise, as before the introduction of PCV. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER Danish Data Protection Agency: 2007-58-0010.},

abstract = {Introduction: Although multiple studies of cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been conducted, no such study has examined Singapore's situation nor compared the licensed conjugate vaccines in an Asian population. This paper estimates the costs and public health impacts of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine programs, varying estimates of serotype replacement and herd immunity effects as key parameters in the analysis. Based in part on a 2008 analysis also presented here, Singapore has approved the PCV-7, PHiD-10, and PCV-13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccines as part of its National Childhood Immunisation Programme. Methods: An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model populated with Singapore-specific population parameters, vaccine costs, treatment costs, and disease incidence data. The vaccinated infant and child cohort of 226,000 was 6{\%} of the Singapore resident population of 3.8 million. Vaccine efficacy estimates were constructed for PCV-7, PHiD-10, and PCV-13 vaccines based on their serotype coverage in Singapore and compared to 'no vaccination'. The model estimated impacts over a five-year time horizon with 3{\%} per year discounting of costs and health effects. Costs were presented in 2010 U.S. dollars (USD) and Singapore dollars (SGD). Sensitivity analyses included varying herd immunity, serotype replacement rates, vaccine cost, and efficacy against acute otitis media. Results: Under base case assumptions for the revised analysis (i.e., herd effects in the unvaccinated population equivalent to 20{\%} of direct effects) PCV-13 prevented 834 cases and 7 deaths due to pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia in the vaccinated population, and 952 cases and 191 deaths in the unvaccinated population over the 5-year time horizon. Including herd effects, the cost-effectiveness ratio for PCV-13 was USD {\$}37,644 (SGD {\$}51,854) per QALY. Without herd effects, however, the ratio was USD {\$}204,535 (SGD {\$}281,743) per QALY. The PCV-7 cost per QALY including herd effects was USD {\$}43,275 (SGD {\$}59,610) and for PHiD-10 the ratios were USD {\$}45,100 (SGD {\$}62,125). The original 2008 analysis, which had higher estimates of pneumonia prevention due to herd immunity and lower estimates of cost per dose, had found a cost-effectiveness ratio of USD {\$}5562 (SGD {\$}7661) per QALY for PCV-7. Conclusions: When compared to cost-effectiveness thresholds recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), our 2008 analysis found that vaccination of infants in Singapore with PCV-7 was very cost-effective if herd immunity effects were present. However, knowledge on herd immunity and serotype replacement that emerged subsequent to this analysis changed our expectations about indirect effects. Given these changed inputs, our current estimates of infant vaccination against pneumococcal disease in Singapore find such programs to be moderately cost-effective compared to WHO thresholds. The different findings from the 2008 and 2011 analyses suggest that the dynamic issue of serotype replacement should be monitored post-licensure and, as changes occur, vaccine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analyses should be re-evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of the current study was to quantify differences in health-related quality-of-life of community-dwelling elderly with and without community-acquired pneumonia during a 12-month follow-up period. METHODS In a matched cohort study design, nested in a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine in community-dwelling persons of ≥65 years, health-related quality-of-life was assessed in 562 subjects hospitalized with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (i.e. diseased cohort) and 1145 unaffected persons (i.e. non-diseased cohort) matched to pneumonia cases on age, sex, and health status (EQ-5D-3L-index). Health-related quality-of-life was determined 1-2 weeks after hospital discharge/inclusion and 1, 6 and 12 months thereafter, using Euroqol EQ-5D-3L and Short Form-36 Health survey questionnaires. One-year quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated for both diseased and non-diseased cohorts. Separate analyses were performed for pneumonia cases with and without radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia. RESULTS The one-year excess QALY loss attributed to community-acquired pneumonia was 0.13. Mortality in the post-discharge follow-up year was 8.4{\%} in community-acquired pneumonia patients and 1.2{\%} in non-diseased persons (p {\textless} 0.001). During follow-up health-related quality-of-life was persistently lower in community-acquired pneumonia patients, compared to non-diseased persons, but differences in health-related quality-of-life between radiologically confirmed and non-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia cases were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Community-acquired pneumonia was associated with a six-fold increased mortality and 16{\%} lower quality-of-life in the post-discharge year among patients surviving hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia, compared to non-diseased persons.

This systematic review aimed to estimate the AOM incidence, bacterial etiology and use of resources in children aged {\textless}6 years in Latin America and the Caribbean (LA{\&}C). Methods: A systematic search using keywords otitis or middle ear and inflammation was performed for articles published during 1988-2008 in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS, generic and academic internet searches, Ministries of Health, PAHO, regional proceedings, reference lists and consulting experts. Pairs of reviewers independently selected articles and assessed their methodological quality with a checklist of essential items from the STROBE statement according to pre-specified criteria. Studies involving immune-competent children with AOM were considered. Arcsine transformations were used for proportion meta-analyses. Results: Annual AOM incidence in four studies in children aged {\textless}5 years ranged from 1,171-36,000 episodes/100,000 children. Meta-analysis on etiology and pneumococcal serotypes included 18 studies and 125, 519 children with AOM from six LA{\&}C countries. Meta-analysis per serotype showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae (32.4{\%}; 95{\%}CI. =27.1-38.0{\%}) and Haemophilus influenzae (26{\%}; 95{\%}CI. =19.5-33.1{\%}), including non-typeable H. influenzae (18.3{\%}; 95{\%}CI. =9.5-33.1{\%}) were the most prevalent. The most commonly observed pneumococcal serotype was 19F (24.0{\%}; 95{\%} CI 17.0-32.0{\%}). Data on use of health resources were scarce. Conclusions: Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the most frequent AOM bacterial pathogens, consistent with the international literature from other regions. Future studies on AOM incidence and health resources usage will help better define the impact of this disease. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into the U.S. childhood immunization schedule in 2000 has substantially reduced the incidence of vaccine-serotype invasive pneumococcal disease in young children and in unvaccinated older children and adults. By 2004, hospitalizations associated with pneumonia from any cause had also declined markedly among young children. Because of concerns about increases in disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes, we wanted to determine whether the reduction in pneumonia-related hospitalizations among young children had been sustained through 2009 and whether such hospitalizations in older age groups had also declined. METHODS: We estimated annual rates of hospitalization for pneumonia from any cause using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. The reason for hospitalization was classified as pneumonia if pneumonia was the first listed diagnosis or if it was listed after a first diagnosis of sepsis, meningitis, or empyema. Average annual rates of pneumonia-related hospitalizations from 1997 through 1999 (before the introduction of PCV7) and from 2007 through 2009 (well after its introduction) were used to estimate annual declines in hospitalizations due to pneumonia. RESULTS: The annual rate of hospitalization for pneumonia among children younger than 2 years of age declined by 551.1 per 100,000 children (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 445.1 to 657.1), which translates to 47,000 fewer hospitalizations annually than expected on the basis of the rates before PCV7 was introduced. The rate for adults 85 years of age or older declined by 1300.8 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI, 984.0 to 1617.6), which translates to 73,000 fewer hospitalizations annually. For the three age groups of 18 to 39 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 to 84 years, the annual rate of hospitalization for pneumonia declined by 8.4 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI, 0.6 to 16.2), 85.3 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI, 7.0 to 163.6), and 359.8 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI, 199.6 to 520.0), respectively. Overall, we estimated an age-adjusted annual reduction of 54.8 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI, 41.0 to 68.5), or 168,000 fewer hospitalizations for pneumonia annually. CONCLUSIONS: Declines in hospitalizations for childhood pneumonia were sustained during the decade after the introduction of PCV7. Substantial reductions in hospitalizations for pneumonia among adults were also observed. (Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.).},

abstract = {Seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was included in the UK national immunisation program in 2006, and this was replaced by thirteen-valent PCV in 2010. During this time, the carriage of vaccine-type Streptococcus pneumoniae decreased but pneumococcal carriage remained stable due to increases in non-vaccine-type S. pneumoniae. Carriage studies have been undertaken in various countries to monitor vaccine-type replacement and to help predict the serotypes, which may cause invasive disease. There has been less focus on how conjugate vaccines indirectly affect colonization of other nasopharyngeal bacteria. If the nasopharynx is treated as a niche, then bacterial dynamics are accepted to occur. Alterations in these dynamics have been shown due to seasonal changes, antibiotic use, and sibling/day care interaction. It has been shown that, following PCV7 introduction, an eradication of pneumococcal vaccine types has resulted in increases in the abundance of other respiratory pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. These changes are difficult to attribute to PCV7 introduction alone and these studies do not account for further changes due to PCV13 implementation. This review aims to describe nasopharyngeal cocarriage of respiratory pathogens in the PCV era.},

Study Design Analysis of the Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases (2010-2012). Subjects and Methods Medical claims data from 2010 to 2012 were analyzed. Children aged ≤12 years with otitis media (OM)-related diagnoses were identified. Adherence and nonadherence rates for OM and PET placement were analyzed through administrative codes extrapolated from the key action statements (KASs) of the CPG. KASs were aggregated to estimate the overall nonadherence and determine areas for quality improvement. Results A total of 9,726,411 visits with OM-associated codes among 3,710,730 children were identified: 2.9{\%} (80,451 of 3,239,700) were considered nonadherent to KAS 1 because a code for PET placement occurred with a first episode of OM with effusion {\textless}3 months; 52.1{\%} (14,534 of 27,913) underwent PET placement for OM with effusion of {\textgreater}3 months and had a concurrent hearing loss code. For those without hearing loss who underwent PET placement, 48.3{\%} (52,921 of 109,583) had a diagnosis code indicating risk for speech, language, or learning problems. For each KAS, we found heterogeneity of computed nonadherence rates by region, age, and season. Conclusion Before guideline dissemination, we found low to moderate rates of nonadherence to guideline recommendation. Deeper analysis of mega-databases could provide better insights for measurement of guideline adherence. The expansion of administrative and clinical databases provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of CPGs.},

However, genetic variation within the same genetic lineage may be larger than anticipated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 715 invasive and carriage isolates from children in the same region and during the same period were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. Bacterial genome sequencing, functional assays, and in vivo virulence mice studies were performed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Clonal types of the same serotype but also intraclonal variants within clonal complexes (CCs) showed differences in invasive-disease potential. CC138, a common CC, was divided into several PFGE patterns, partly explained by number, location, and type of temperate bacteriophages. Whole-genome sequencing of 4 CC138 isolates representing PFGE clones with different invasive-disease potentials revealed intraclonal sequence variations of the virulence-associated proteins pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and pneumococcal choline-binding protein C (PspC). A carrier isolate lacking PcpA exhibited decreased virulence in mice, and there was a differential binding of human factor H, depending on invasiveness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal clonal types but also intraclonal variants exhibited different invasive-disease potentials in children. Intraclonal variants, reflecting different prophage contents, showed differences in major surface antigens. This suggests ongoing immune selection, such as that due to PspC-mediated complement resistance through varied human factor H binding, that may affect invasiveness in children.},

abstract = {Otitis media is a prominent disease among children. Previous literature indicates that otitis media is a polymicrobial disease, with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Alloiococcus otitidis and Moraxella catarrhalis being the most commonly associated bacterial pathogens. Recent literature suggests that introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has had an effect on the etiology of otitis media. Using a multiplex PCR procedure, we sought to investigate the presence of the aforementioned bacterial pathogens in middle ear fluid collected from children undergoing routine tympanostomy tube placement at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center during the period between January 2011 and March 2014. In purulent effusions, one or more bacterial organisms were detected in {\~{}}90{\%} of samples. Most often the presence of H. influenzae alone was detected in purulent effusions (32{\%}; 10 of 31). In non-purulent effusions, the most prevalent organism detected was A. otitidis (26{\%}; 63 of 245). Half of the non-purulent effusions had none of these otopathogens detected. In purulent and non-purulent effusions, the overall presence of S. pneumoniae was lower (19{\%}; 6 of 31, and 4{\%}; 9 of 245, respectively) than that of the other pathogens being identified. The ratio of the percentage of each otopathogen identified in purulent vs. non-purulent effusions was {\textgreater}1 for the classic otopathogens but not for A. otitidis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The role of the different capsular and clonal types in invasive disease severity remains to be defined. METHODS: Disease severity and disease type were correlated to age, underlying disease, capsular serotype, and clonal type of the causative agent for 494 adult patients with invasive pneumococcal disease. RESULTS: Pneumococcal isolates of serotypes 1 and 7F were genetically homogenous, had the highest potential to infect previously healthy individuals, and were not causing deaths. Also, type 1 isolates were only found among younger adults, whereas other serotypes were mainly found among elderly persons (e.g., type 23F). Some serotypes and/or clones were more prone to cause more-severe disease, as observed by high APACHE II scores calculated at admission, and were also associated with a high mortality (e.g., clones of type 3 and 11A). We found no evidence of an impact of penicillin resistance on disease severity and disease type. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that clones with capsular types 1 and 7F, which are known to have a high invasive disease potential, behave as primary pathogens, whereas clones with other capsular types with a lower relative risk of causing invasive disease are more opportunistic, primarily affecting patients with underlying disease. Disease caused by the latter group, however, was more severe, even in previously healthy individuals.},

Pneumococci were recovered during 362 (63{\%}) of 573 fortnights, and 219 (60{\%}) of these isolates showed decreased susceptibility to at least one drug; 154 (43{\%}) were intermediately susceptible to penicillin and 51 (14{\%}) were multiresistant. Combining the different typing methods showed that a limited number of clones circulated in the facility. Clones exhibiting decreased antibiotic susceptibility (especially 23F, intermediately susceptible to penicillin and resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and multiresistant 6B) were more frequently isolated and persisted longer than did fully susceptible clones. By multivariate analysis, carriage of organisms with decreased antibiotic susceptibility was associated with young age, female sex, winter season, and exposure to antimicrobial drugs during the previous month.},

The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of PHiD-CV in comparison to non-vaccination in children under 10 years of age in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. METHODS: We used a static, deterministic, compartmental simulation model. The dosing regimen considered included three vaccine doses (at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months) and a booster dose (at 13 months) (3 + 1 schedule). Model outcomes included number of cases prevented, deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and costs. Discount for costs and benefits of long term sequelae was done at 3.5{\%}, and currency reported in 2008-2009 U{\$}S varying between countries. RESULTS: The largest effect in case prevention was observed in pneumococcal meningitis (from 27{\%} in Peru to 47{\%} in Colombia), neurologic sequelae after meningitis (from 38{\%} in Peru to 65{\%} in Brazil) and bacteremia (from 42{\%} in Argentina to 49{\%} in Colombia). The proportion of predicted deaths averted annually ranged from 18{\%} in Peru to 33{\%} in Brazil. Overall, the health benefits achieved with PHiD-CV vaccination resulted in a lower QALY loss (from 15{\%} lower in Peru to 26{\%} in Brazil). At a cost of USD 20 per vaccine dose, vaccination was cost-effective in all countries, from being cost saving in Chile to a maximum Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio of 7,088 US{\$} Dollars per QALY gained. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis, and scenarios with indirect costs affected results more than those with herd immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into routine infant immunization programs in Latin American countries could be a cost-effective strategy to improve infant population health in the region.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND. In 2001, Australia introduced a unique 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) 2-, 4-, and 6-month schedule with a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) booster for Aboriginal children, and in 2005, 7vPCV alone in a 2-, 4-, and 6-month schedule for non-Aboriginal children. Aboriginal adults are offered 23vPPV but coverage is poor. We investigated trends in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Western Australia (WA). METHODS. Enhanced IPD surveillance has been ongoing since 1996. We calculated IPD incidence rates for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians before and after introduction of 7vPCV. RESULTS. A total of 1792 cases occurred during the period 1997-2007; the IPD incidence rate was 47 cases per 100,000 population per year among Aboriginal people and 7 cases per 100,000 population per year in non-Aboriginal people. After introduction of 7vPCV, IPD rates among Aboriginal children decreased by 46{\%} for those {\textless}2 years of age and by 40{\%} for those 2-4 years of age; rates decreased by 64{\%} and 51{\%} in equivalent age groups for non-Aboriginal children. IPD rates decreased by {\textgreater}30{\%} in non-Aboriginal people 50 years of age but increased among Aboriginal adults (eg, from 59.1 to 109.6 cases per 100,000 population per year among those 30-49 years of age). Although IPD due to 7vPCV serotypes decreased in all age groups, IPD incidence due to non-7vPCV serotypes increased, and it almost doubled among Aboriginal adults 30-49 years of age (from 48.3 to 97.0 cases per 100,000 population per year). Among non-Aboriginal children, 37{\%} of IPD is now due to serotype 19A. CONCLUSIONS. IPD incidence rates have decreased markedly among children and non-Aboriginal adults with a 3-dose infant 7vPCV schedule. However, IPD due to non-7vPCV serotypes has increased and is of particular concern among young Aboriginal adults, for whom an intensive 23vPPV campaign is needed. An immunization register covering all age groups should be established.},

Study Design and Setting We completed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and reference lists to identify English language articles through to December 2013 that used interrupted time series methods in drug utilization research. We tabulated the number of studies by publication year and summarized methodological detail. Results We identified 220 eligible empirical applications since 1984. Only 17 (8{\%}) were published before 2000, and 90 (41{\%}) were published since 2010. Segmented regression was the most commonly applied interrupted time series method (67{\%}). Most studies assessed drug policy changes (51{\%}, n = 112); 22{\%} (n = 48) examined the impact of new evidence, 18{\%} (n = 39) examined safety advisories, and 16{\%} (n = 35) examined quality improvement interventions. Autocorrelation was considered in 66{\%} of studies, 31{\%} reported adjusting for seasonality, and 15{\%} accounted for nonstationarity. Conclusion Use of interrupted time series methods in drug utilization research has increased, particularly in recent years. Despite methodological recommendations, there is large variation in reporting of analytic methods.

abstract = {To investigate determinants of antibiotic prescription in paediatric care, as a first step of a multilevel intervention to improve prescribing for common respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in a northern Italian region with high antibiotic prescription rate. A two-step survey was performed: in phase I, knowledge, and attitudes were explored involving all family and hospital paediatricians of Emilia-Romagna and a sample of parents. In phase II, patient care practices were explored in a stratified random sample of visits, both in hospitals and family physician's clinics; parent expectations were investigated in a sub-sample of these visits. Out of overall 4352 visits for suspected RTIs, in 38{\%} of children an antibiotic was prescribed. Diagnostic uncertainty was perceived by paediatricians as the most frequent cause of inappropriate prescription (56{\%} of 633 interviewed paediatricians); but, rapid antigen detecting tests was used in case of pharyngitis/pharyngotonsillitis by 36{\%} and 21{\%} of family and hospital paediatricians only. More than 50{\%} of paediatricians affirmed to not adopt a "wait and see strategy" in acute otitis. The perceived parental expectation of antibiotics was not indicated by paediatricians as a crucial determinant of prescription, but this perception was the second factor most strongly associated to prescription (OR = 12.8; 95{\%} CI 10.4 - 15.8), the first being the presence of othorrea. Regarding parents, the most important identified factors, potentially associated to overprescribing, were the lack of knowledge of RTIs and antibiotics (41{\%} of 1029 parents indicated bacteria as a possible cause of common cold), and the propensity to seek medical care for trivial infections (48{\%} of 4352 children accessing ambulatory practice presented only symptoms of common cold). A wide gap between perceived and real determinants of antibiotic prescription exists. This can promote antibiotic overuse. Inadequate parental knowledge can also induce inappropriate prescription. The value of this study is that it simultaneously explored determinants of antimicrobial prescribing in an entire region involving both professionals and parents.},

Among 233 isolates, 128 (55{\%}) were not susceptible to penicillin (25.3{\%} were intermediately susceptible, and 29.6{\%} were resistant). Clinical severity of pneumococcal pneumonia was not significantly different between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible groups. Mortality rates among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia caused by penicillin-, cephalosporin-, or macrolide-resistant strains were not higher than those with antibiotic-susceptible pneumococcal pneumonia. Bacteremia and mechanical ventilation were significant risk factors for death, but any kind of antibiotic resistance was not associated with increased mortality due to pneumococcal pneumonia. Outcome of pneumococcal pneumonia was not significantly affected by drug resistance, and current antimicrobial regimens are mostly effective in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, despite the widespread emergence of in vitro resistance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: National guidelines recommend obtaining blood cultures in children hospitalized with moderate or severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of bacteremia in children, identify factors associated with bacteremia and quantify the influence of positive blood cultures on clinical management in children hospitalized with CAP.

METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included children from 60 days to 18 years of age requiring hospitalization for CAP. Categories analyzed were bacteremia, culture negative and no culture.

RESULTS: Blood cultures were performed in 369 (56{\%}) of 658 children with CAP. The prevalence of bacteremia was 7{\%} (4.7-10.1{\%}) in patients with a blood culture obtained. Bacteremia occurred in 21{\%} of patients with a pleural drainage procedure and 75{\%} of patients with distant site of infection (eg, osteomyelitis). Patients with bacteremia had longer duration of fever before admission and higher C-reactive protein values compared with those with negative or no blood culture. However, differences in white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate between those with bacteremia and those without were not significant. Contamination rates were low and similar across institutions, ranging from 1{\%} to 3.8{\%} (P = 0.63). Blood culture-directed changes in antibiotic management occurred in 33{\%} of patients with a contaminated culture and 65{\%} of bacteremic patients. Antibiotic therapy was narrowed in 26{\%} of bacteremic patients at hospital discharge.

CONCLUSION: The prevalence of bacteremia was higher than previously reported in children hospitalized with CAP and consistent across children's hospitals. Positive blood cultures should prompt change to narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy.},

abstract = {GABHS is the most common bacterial cause of tonsillopharyngitis, but this organism also produces acute otitis media; pneumonia; skin and soft-tissue infections; cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic infections; bacteremia; and meningitis. Most children and adolescents who develop a sore throat do not have GABHS as the cause; their infection is viral in etiology. Other bacterial pathogens produce sore throat infrequently (e.g., Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae), and when they do, other concomitant clinical illness is present. Classic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis has an acute onset; produces concurrent headache, stomach ache, and dysphagia; and upon examination is characterized by intense tonsillopharyngeal erythema, yellow exudate, and tender/enlarged anterior cervical glands. Unfortunately only about 20{\%} to 30{\%} of patients present with classic disease. Physicians overdiagnose streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis by a wide margin, which almost always leads to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. Accordingly, use of throat cultures and/or rapid GABHS detection tests in the office is strongly advocated. Their use has been shown to be cost-effective and to reduce antibiotic overprescribing substantially. Penicillin currently is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association as first-line therapy for GABHS infections; erythromycin is recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Virtually all patients improve clinically with penicillin and other antibiotics. However, penicillin treatment failures do occur, especially in tonsillopharyngitis in which 5{\%} to 35{\%} of patients do not experience bacteriologic eradication. Penicillin treatment failures are more common among patients who have been treated recently with the drug. Cephalosporins or azithromycin are preferred following penicillin treatment failures in selected patients as first-line therapy, based on a history of penicillin failures or lack of compliance and for impetigo. GABHS remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin in vitro. There are several explanations for penicillin treatment failures, but the possibility of copathogen co-colonization in vivo has received the most attention. Treatment duration with penicillin should be 10 days to optimize cure in GABHS infections. A 5-day regimen is possible and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for cefpodoxime (a cephalosporin) and azithromycin (a macrolide). Prevention of rheumatic fever is the primary objective for antibiotic therapy of GABHS infections, but a reduction in contagion and faster clinical improvement also can be achieved. Development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis ("flesh-eating bacteria") are rising concerns. The portal of entry for these invasive GABHS strains is far more often skin and soft tissue than the tonsillopharynx.},

Study design This cross-sectional analysis used all-payer claims to calculate rates of tympanostomy tube insertions for insured children ages 2-8 years (2007-2010) across pediatric surgical areas (PSA) for Northern New England (NNE; Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire) and the English National Health Service Primary Care Trusts (PCT). Rates were compared with expected rates estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that integrates clinical guidelines and published probabilities of the incidence and course of otitis media with effusion. Results Observed rates of tympanostomy tube placement varied {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}30-fold across English PCT (N???=???150) and {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}3-fold across NNE PSA (N???=???30). At a 25???dB hearing threshold, the overall difference in observed to expected tympanostomy tubes provided was ???3.41 per 1000 child-years in England and ???0.01 per 1000 child-years in NNE. Observed incidence of insertion was less than expected in 143 of 151 PCT, and was higher than expected in one-half of the PSA. Using a 20???dB hearing threshold, there were fewer tube insertions than expected in all but 2 England and 7 NNE areas. There was an inverse relationship between estimated need and observed tube insertion rates. Conclusions Regional variations in observed tympanostomy tube insertion rates are unlikely to be due to differences in need and suggest overall underuse in England and both overuse and underuse in NNE.},

abstract = {Universal infant vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has nearly eliminated PCV7-serotype invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in young U.S. children, but has been accompanied by increases in the incidence of serotype 19A IPD. Because antibiotic-non-susceptible 19A has increased more than antibiotic-susceptible 19A, antibiotic selection pressure could be contributing to this trend. We developed a dynamic compartmental transmission model of pneumococcus to better understand the causes of this rise and to estimate the impact of vaccines or changes in antibiotic use on future IPD incidence in the U.S. in {\textless}2 year-olds. The model predicted that with current practices, serotype 19A IPD incidence will plateau at about the 2007 level over the next few years. The model suggests that antibiotic usage played a major role in the rise in antibiotic-non-susceptible 19A IPD, with a lesser contribution from PCV7 vaccination. However, hypothetical large decreases in antibiotic use starting in 2008 are predicted to yield only gradual decreases in antibiotic-non-susceptible 19A IPD. On the other hand, vaccines with modest (20{\%}) effectiveness against 19A (or 6A or PCV7-serotypes) carriage are predicted to substantially (by 80{\%}) decrease the incidence of IPD caused by those serotypes within 10 years of implementation. Our findings highlight that vaccine effects on colonization are key to their overall benefits. In addition, serotype changes following vaccine introduction may have multifactorial origins, with antibiotic use an important factor for resistant strains such as 19A.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Trends in antibiotic prescriptions among children attending day-care centres (DCCs) were studied before and after campaigns promoting prudent antibiotic use and the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional studies were conducted on a two-stage cluster sample of children aged 3 months to 4 years attending DCCs the Alpes Maritimes in France between January and March in 1999, 2004 and 2008. Antibiotic treatments given in the previous 3 months and their indications were studied.

INTERVENTIONS: A local public health intervention promoting prudent paediatric antibiotic prescriptions was implemented in 2000 and followed by a nationwide campaign in 2002.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in the number and type of antibiotic prescriptions, and indications for antibiotic use, over the study period.

RESULTS: 217, 254 and 279 children provided information in 1999, 2004 and 2008, respectively. The proportion of children who had received antibiotics within the previous 3 months fell from 58.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 51.7{\%} to 65.2{\%}) in 1999 to 29.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 24.4 to 35.5) in 2008. The number of treated episodes/child dropped from 0.99±1.14 to 0.35±1.16 (p{\textless}0.00001). Otitis media accounted for an increasing percentage of antibiotic use, rising from 35.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 29.0{\%} to 42.2{\%}) to 56.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 46.3{\%} to 66.6{\%}). Prescriptions for third-generation cephalosporins increased from 26.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 20.4{\%} to 32.5{\%}) to 49.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 39.2{\%} to 59.7{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric antibiotic prescriptions dropped significantly following campaigns and the introduction of pneumococcal immunisation in France. Improvements are still needed regarding indications and choice of compounds.},

Whether this results in higher use of healthcare resources during childhood remains unknown. We aim to assess the effect of first year daycare attendance on the timing and use of healthcare resources for URTI and AOM episodes during early childhood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In the Wheezing-Illnesses-STudy-LEidsche-Rijn birth cohort, 2,217 children were prospectively followed up to age six years. Children were categorized according to first-year daycare attendance (yes versus no) and age at entry when applicable (age 0 to 2 months, 3 to 5 months and 6 to 12 months). Information on general practitioner (GP) diagnosed URTI and AOM, GP consultations, antibiotic prescriptions and specialist referral was collected from medical records. Daycare attendance was recorded by monthly questionnaires during the first year of life.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: First-year daycare attendees and non-attendees had similar total six-year rates of GP-diagnosed URTI and AOM episodes (59/100 child-years, 95{\%} confidence interval 57 to 61 versus 56/100 child-years, 53 to 59). Daycare attendees had more GP-diagnosed URTI and AOM episodes before the age of one year and fewer beyond the age of four years than non-attendees (Pinteraction {\textless}0.001). Daycare attendees had higher total six-year rates for GP consultation (adjusted rate ratio 1.15, 1.00 to 1.31) and higher risk for specialist referrals (hazard ratio: 1.43, 1.01 to 2.03). The number of antibiotic prescriptions in the first six years of life was only significantly increased among children who entered daycare between six to twelve months of age (rate ratio 1.32, 1.04 to 1.67). This subgroup of child-care attendees also had the highest overall URTI and AOM incidence rates, GP consultation rates and risk for specialist referral.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Children who enter daycare in the first year of life, have URTI and AOM at an earlier age, leading to higher use of healthcare resources compared to non-attendees, especially when entering daycare between six to twelve months. These findings emphasize the need for improved prevention strategies in daycare facilities to lower infection rates at the early ages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Close family and day-care contacts have been identified as risk factors for pneumococcal (Pnc) carriage. This study addresses the risk of Pnc carriage by infants 2 to 24 months of age in terms of simultaneous carriage of pneumococcus by family members. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 100 Finnish infants and their family members on 10 scheduled visits (when infant was 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months of age). The 7 most common pneumococcal serogroups (4, 6, 9, 14, 18, 19, 23), also represented in the new heptavalent Pnc conjugate vaccine, were analyzed. Marginal logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relative importance of different predictors for carriage. RESULTS: The carriage of the studied Pnc serogroups increased with age, being highest at the age of 18 months (28{\%}). Among children older than 6 months of age, the strongest predictor of carriage was simultaneous carriage of the same serogroup by another family member (odds ratio, 3.8; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.1 to 6.9). At the age of 6 months or younger, carriage was rare and was not significantly associated with a family carriage. CONCLUSIONS: Young infants ({\textless} or =6 months old) were largely protected from pneumococcal carriage. After this age family transmission seemed very important despite the small family size. Contrary to some earlier studies communal day care was not associated with an increased risk of Pnc carriage. This could be partly because of the long parental leave in Finland and thus the late age of starting organized day care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS Viral-bacterial coinfections in humans are well-documented. Viral infections often lead to bacterial superinfections. In vitro and animal models for influenza, as well as molecular microbiology study of viruses and bacteria, provide an understanding of the mechanisms that explain how respiratory viruses and bacteria combine to cause disease. This article focuses on viral and bacterial combinations, particularly synergism between influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae. RESULTS Potential mechanisms for synergism between viruses and bacteria include: virus destruction of respiratory epithelium may increase bacterial adhesion; virus-induced immunosuppression may cause bacterial superinfections; and inflammatory response to viral infection may up-regulate expression of molecules that bacteria utilize as receptors. Influenza and parainfluenza viruses possess neuraminidase (NA) activity, which appears to increase bacterial adherence after viral preincubation. Experimental studies demonstrate that viral NA exposes pneumococcal receptors on host cells by removing terminal sialic acids. Other studies show that inhibition of viral NA activity reduces adherence and invasion of S. pneumoniae, independently of effects on viral replication. Clinical studies reveal that influenza vaccination reduces the incidence of secondary bacterial respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS Detection of viral factors (e.g. high NA activity) that increase the likely potential of epidemic/pandemic influenza strains for causing morbidity and mortality from secondary bacterial infections provides new possibilities for intervention. Additional study is needed to identify the mechanisms for the development of bacterial complications after infections with respiratory syncytial virus and other important respiratory viruses that lack NA activity. Prevention of bacterial superinfection is likely to depend on effective antiviral measures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media (AOM) affects both child and parental quality of life (QoL). Data on QoL associated with AOM in Malaysia is sparse, and the burden of indirect costs have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of pediatric AOM on child and parental QoL in Malaysia and its economic impact (indirect costs). METHODS We utilized a set of QoL questionnaires (PAR-AOM-QOL, OM-6, and EQ-5D) combined with questions addressing work/productivity loss and financial costs associated with caring for a child during his or her illness in an observational, multicenter, prospective study. RESULTS One hundred and ten AOM patients aged ≤5 years were included in the analysis. The majority of respondents were the patient's mother. Parental QoL was negatively affected for both emotional and daily disturbance scales, but the level of disturbance was low. Using OM-6, the greatest negative impact was on the child's QoL, followed by caregiver concerns, physical suffering, and emotional distress. Using EQ-5D, a moderately positive relationship between parents' emotional disturbance and daily disturbance, and a weak, negative correlation between parental emotional disturbance and parental health status was found. Parents with paid employment took an average of 21 h from work to care for their child, at an average cost of 321.8 Malaysian ringgit (US{\$}97) in addition to their contribution to direct medical costs. Productivity losses whilst at work, uncompensated wage losses, and leisure time losses are also reported. CONCLUSIONS This study found that AOM is associated with some negative impact on parental QoL and significant economic impact at both patient and societal levels. The findings provide useful data on healthcare resource utilization and disease burden of AOM in Malaysia.},

abstract = {Background The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) showed that early intervention with cardiac-resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in patients with an electrocardiographic pattern showing left bundle-branch block was associated with a significant reduction in heart-failure events over a median follow-up of 2.4 years, as compared with defibrillator therapy alone. Methods We evaluated the effect of CRT-D on long-term survival in the MADIT-CRT population. Post-trial follow-up over a median period of 5.6 years was assessed among all 1691 surviving patients (phase 1) and subsequently among 854 patients who were enrolled in post-trial registries (phase 2). All reported analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results At 7 years of follow-up after initial enrollment, the cumulative rate of death from any cause among patients with left bundle-branch block was 18{\%} among patients randomly assigned to CRT-D, as compared with 29{\%} among those randomly assigned to defibrillator therapy alone (adjusted hazard ratio in the CRT-D group, 0.59; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.80; P{\textless}0.001). The long-term survival benefit of CRT-D in patients with left bundle-branch block did not differ significantly according to sex, cause of cardiomyopathy, or QRS duration. In contrast, CRT-D was not associated with any clinical benefit and possibly with harm in patients without left bundle-branch block (adjusted hazard ratio for death from any cause, 1.57; 95{\%} CI, 1.03 to 2.39; P=0.04; P{\textless}0.001 for interaction of treatment with QRS morphologic findings). Conclusions Our findings indicate that in patients with mild heart-failure symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction, and left bundle-branch block, early intervention with CRT-D was associated with a significant long-term survival benefit.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Considerable controversy surrounds whether a history of otitis media with effusion (OME) in early childhood causes later speech and language problems. We conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies to determine: 1) whether a history of OME in early childhood is related to receptive language, expressive language, vocabulary, syntax, or speech development in children 1 to 5 years old and 2) whether hearing loss caused by otitis media in early childhood is related to children's receptive language or expressive language through 2 years of age. METHODS We searched online databases and bibliographies of OME studies and reviews for prospective or randomized clinical trials published between January 1966 and October 2002 that examined the relationship of OME or OME-associated hearing loss in early childhood to children's later speech and language development. The original search identified 38 studies, of which 14 had data suitable for calculating a pooled correlation coefficient (correlational studies) or standard difference between parallel groups (group studies). Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool data when at least 3 studies had usable data for a particular outcome. RESULTS We performed 11 meta-analyses. There were no significant findings for the analyses of OME during early childhood versus receptive or expressive language during the preschool years in the correlation studies. Similarly, there were no significant findings for OME versus vocabulary, syntax, or speech during the preschool years. Conversely, there was a significant negative association between OME and preschoolers' receptive and expressive language (lower language) (0.24 and 0.25 standard difference, respectively) in the group studies. Additionally, hearing was also related to receptive and expressive language in infancy (3{\%}-9{\%} of variance). CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate no to very small negative associations of OME and associated hearing loss to children's later speech and language development. These findings may overestimate the impact of OME on outcomes, because most studies did not adjust for known confounding variables (such as socioeconomic status) and excluded data not suitable for statistical pooling, especially from methodologically sound studies. Although some OME language differences were detectable by meta-analysis due to increased statistical power, the clinical relevance for otherwise healthy children is uncertain.},

In 11 villages (the vaccine group), all residents received 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7), while in another 10 villages (the control group), only children {\textless}30 months old or born during the study period received PCV-7. Cross-sectional surveys (CSSs) were conducted to collect nasopharyngeal swabs before vaccination (baseline CSS) and 4, 12, and 22 months after vaccination.

Mean pneumococcal density was compared in CSSs conducted before and after vaccination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mean bacterial density among colonized individuals in the baseline CSS was 2.57 for vaccine-type (VT) and non-vaccine-type (NVT) pneumococci; it decreased with age (P {\textless} .001 for VT and NVT).

PCV7 lowered the density of pneumococcal nasopharingeal carriage of both VT and NVT pneomococci. 

Children have a considerably higher density of pneomococci than do adults which might explain why they are the main vector of transmission.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test a method of measuring the related cost of acute otitis media (AOM) and to provide a preliminary calculation of the indirect and directs costs associated with a single, medically treated episode of AOM. DESIGN: The Otitis Media Diary was used to measure indirect and direct costs associated with AOM in a prospective cohort study. Measured values included the parental time spent in otitis-specific child care and the number and type of medications used. A previously developed economic model was used to calculate the monetary costs associated with the value of caregiver time and the total opportunity cost of AOM. SETTING: The pediatric clinic of Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, Wash. PATIENTS: A cohort of 25 children (12 with AOM and 13 controls) aged 1 to 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Caregiver time and medication use. RESULTS: The total cost attributable to AOM in the 3-month period following diagnosis was {\$}1330.58 (95{\%} confidence interval, {\$}1008.75-{\$}1652.43), with the majority of that cost stemming from the indirect, rather than direct, costs of illness. After conservative estimates of unmeasured expenses, such as clinic visits and transportation, were accounted for, indirect costs, accrued primarily by parental time, accounted for nearly 90{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 87.1{\%}-92.3{\%}) of the total 3-month cost associated with AOM and its medical treatment. The cost items of the Otitis Media Diary were also highly correlated with each other and with other measures of clinical and functional health status. CONCLUSIONS: Otitis Media Diary measures of parental time and medication use appear to provide a more accurate means of calculating the real social costs attributable to the AOM disease process in this cost-effectiveness analysis},

Every child under 17 years old who received tubes during this 10-year period was identified and analyzed. The tube insertion rates in different age groups and the risk to receive tubes in different birth cohorts before and after the release of the vaccine in 2005 were compared. RESULTS The tube insertion rates for children under 17 years of age ranged from 21.6 to 31.9 for 100,000 persons/year. The tube insertion rate of children under 2 years old decreased significantly after 2005 in period effect analysis ({\$}\beta{\$} = -0.074, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05, and the negative {\$}\beta{\$} value means a downward trend) and increased in children 2 to 9 years old throughout the study period (positive {\$}\beta{\$} values which mean upward trends, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05). The rate of tube insertion was lower in 2004-2005 and 2006-2007 birth cohorts than that of 2002-2003 birth cohort (RR = 0.90 and 0.21, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 0.83-0.97 and 0.19-0.23, resp.).

abstract = {Newer antibiotics have higher acquisition costs than the first-line antibiotics but may offer superior outcomes, including enhanced eradication of resistant organisms, safety, and compliance in the treatment of acute otitis media. A rational choice among differing therapies should systematically address all these factors. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to compare the commonly used second-line antibiotics--cefaclor (CEF), amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMX-CLA), and erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (ERY-SULF). A meta-analysis of comparative clinical trials was performed to derive point estimates with a 95{\%} confidence interval for rates of success and adverse events. Costs for drugs, laboratory tests, and physician visits were obtained from the government formulary and fee schedules. The cost for management of adverse events was estimated from the findings of a survey of pediatricians. Utilities (preferences or ratings of health states) were derived from responses of physicians to a standardized scenario of acute otitis media with combinations of adverse events. These utilities were used to obtain quality-adjusted life-day (QALD) scores over a 30-day horizon as a measure of effectiveness. Overall cost and QALD were calculated using decision analytic modeling. CEF performed significantly better than the two other drug treatments with the lowest expected cost ({\$}108.00) and highest outcome (28.15 QALD); AMX-CLA was second in cost and third in outcome ({\$}119.00, 27.98 QALD); and ERY-SULF was third in cost and second in outcome ({\$}120.00, 28.03 QALD). These rankings were robust to variations in event rates over the 95{\%} confidence interval. In this analysis, CEF was the most cost-effective antibiotic strategy for second-line therapy when differential success rates, adverse-event profiles, and impact on quality-of-life were considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Data on the burden of pneumococcal disease and the most frequent serotypes demonstrated that invasive disease and pneumonia were important manifestations affecting children under 5 years of age. Therefore, pneumococcal diseases prevention became a public health priority. Uruguay was the first Latin American country to incorporate PCV7 into its National Immunization Program. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence rates for hospitalized pneumonia in children from the pre PCV introduction period and the following five years of PCVs application in Uruguay. METHODS AND FINDINGS Population-based surveillance of pneumonia hospitalization rates, in children, less than 14 years of age, had been performed prior pneumococcal vaccination, and continued following PCV7 introduction and PCV13 replacement, using the same methodology. Hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled from January 1, 2009 through December 31st, 2012. The study was carried out in an area with a population of 238,002 inhabitants of whom 18, 055 were under five years of age. Patients with acute lower respiratory infections for whom a chest radiograph was performed on admission were eligible. Digitalized radiographs were interpreted by a reference radiologist, using WHO criteria. Pneumonia was confirmed in 2,697 patients, 1,267 with consolidated and 1,430 with non consolidated pneumonia of which incidence decrease, between 2009 and 2012, was 27.3{\%} and 46.4{\%} respectively. 2001-2004 and 2009-2012 comparison showed a significant difference of 20.4{\%} for consolidated pneumonia hospitalizations. A significant incidence decline was recorded among children 6 to 35 months of age. CONCLUSIONS An overall significant reduction in pneumonia hospitalizations was observed following the introduction of PCV7 and furthermore following the change to PCV13.},

abstract = {Health economists often use log models to deal with skewed outcomes, such as health utilization or health expenditures. The literature provides a number of alternative estimation approaches for log models, including ordinary least-squares on ln(y) and generalized linear models. This study examines how well the alternative estimators behave econometrically in terms of bias and precision when the data are skewed or have other common data problems (heteroscedasticity, heavy tails, etc.). No single alternative is best under all conditions examined. The paper provides a straightforward algorithm for choosing among the alternative estimators. Even if the estimators considered are consistent, there can be major losses in precision from selecting a less appropriate estimator. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To monitor clinical and microbiologic features including antimicrobial susceptibility and serogroup distribution of invasive infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae among children before and after the introduction of routine administration of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). DESIGN: A 9-year (January 1, 1994 through December 31, 2002) prospective surveillance study of all invasive pneumococcal infections in children. PATIENTS: Infants and children cared for at 8 children's hospitals in the United States with culture-proven invasive infections caused by S pneumoniae. RESULTS: When compared with the mean of the years 1994 to 2000, the annual number of invasive pneumococcal infections for children {\textless} or =24 months of age declined 58{\%} in 2001 and 66{\%} in 2002. If only the serogroups in the PCV7 are considered, the number of cases in children {\textless} or =24 months old declined 63{\%} and 77{\%} in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The greatest decrease was observed for serogroup-14 isolates. The number of isolates in nonvaccine serogroups increased 28{\%} in 2001 and 66{\%} in 2002 for children {\textless} or =24 months old. Nonvaccine serogroup-15 and -33 isolates had the greatest increase in number. The proportion of all isolates nonsusceptible to penicillin increased yearly from 1994 to 2000, reached a plateau in 2001 at 45{\%}, and declined to 33{\%} in 2002. Decrease in nonsusceptibility to penicillin occurred entirely in the isolates with penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration {\textgreater} or =2 microg/mL. Nonsusceptibility to penicillin increased slightly among nonvaccine-serotype isolates. Most infections after at least 2 doses of PCV7 were caused by nonvaccine-serotype isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of the PCV7, the number of invasive pneumococcal infections caused by vaccine-serogroup isolates among 8 US children's hospitals has decreased {\textgreater}75{\%} among children {\textless} or =24 months old. In addition, penicillin resistance decreased in 2002 for the first time since our surveillance began in 1993-1994. However, we have noted that replacement may be developing with serogroups 15 and 33. Furthermore, penicillin resistance seems to be increasing among nonvaccine serogroups. Surveillance must be continued to detect the emergence of changes in the distribution of serotypes as well as antibiotic susceptibility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) can cause invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM). Both the 10-valent pneumococcal NTHi protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) are included in the National Immunization Program for infants in Korea. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 3+1 schedule of PHiD-CV versus that of PCV-13 for National Immunization Program in Korea. METHODS A published Markov model was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating the 2012 birth cohort with PHiD-CV vs. PCV-13 from the Korean government perspective over 10 y. Best available published data were used for epidemiology, vaccine efficacy and disutilities. Data on incidence and direct medical costs were taken from the national insurance claims database. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the robustness of the results. RESULTS PHiD-CV was projected to prevent an additional 195,262 cases of pneumococcal diseases and NTHi-related diseases vs. PCV-13, with a substantially greater reduction in NTHi-related AOM and a comparable reduction in IPD and community-acquired pneumonia. Parity-priced PHiD-CV generated a health gain of about 844 quality-adjusted life years and a total cost-saving of approximately 4 million United States Dollars (USD) over 10 y. 93{\%} of probabilistic simulations found PHiD-CV 3+1 to be the dominant vaccine option. CONCLUSION Compared to PCV-13, PHiD-CV was projected to provide similar prevention against IPD and community-acquired pneumonia but would prevent more cases of AOM. Parity-priced PHiD-CV was anticipated to generate substantial cost-savings and health benefits vs. PCV-13 in Korea.},

abstract = {Background In the field of pharmacist intervention research it is often difficult to conform to the rigorous requirements of the "true experimental" models, especially the requirement of randomization. When randomization is not feasible, a practice based researcher can choose from a range of "quasi-experimental designs" i.e., non-randomised and at time non controlled. Objective The aim of this article was to provide an overview of quasi-experimental designs, discuss their strengths and weaknesses and to investigate their application in pharmacist intervention research over the previous decade. Results In the literature quasi experimental studies may be classified into five broad categories: quasi-experimental design without control groups; quasi-experimental design that use control groups with no pre-test; quasi-experimental design that use control groups and pre-tests; interrupted time series and stepped wedge designs. Quasi-experimental study design has consistently featured in the evolution of pharmacist intervention research. The most commonly applied of all quasi experimental designs in the practice based research literature are the one group pre-post-test design and the non-equivalent control group design i.e., (untreated control group with dependent pre-tests and post-tests) and have been used to test the impact of pharmacist interventions in general medications management as well as in specific disease states. Conclusion Quasi experimental studies have a role to play as proof of concept, in the pilot phases of interventions when testing different intervention components, especially in complex interventions. They serve to develop an understanding of possible intervention effects: while in isolation they yield weak evidence of clinical efficacy, taken collectively, they help build a body of evidence in support of the value of pharmacist interventions across different practice settings and countries. However, when a traditional RCT is not feasible for logistical and/or ethical reasons researchers should endeavour to use the more robust of the quasi experimental designs.},

abstract = {Objectives: The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential health impact of universal vaccination of infants with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in China. Methods: A decision-analytic model designed for pneumococcal disease and outcomes of pneumococcal infection was populated with local age-specific incidence and mortality data to estimate the expected health benefits of vaccinating birth cohorts of approximately 16 million infants per year over a 10-year time horizon in China. The model incorporates both the direct impact on vaccinated children and the indirect effect of herd protection on unvaccinated children and adults. Results: The model predicts that more than 16.2 million cases of pneumococcal disease and 709 411 deaths could be prevented in China over the initial 10-year period following the introduction of the PCV7 vaccine. The majority of these health benefits are due to the indirect effectiveness of the vaccine on the unvaccinated population, resulting in approximately 10.8 million cases prevented and 636 371 lives saved over 10 years. Conclusions: The results suggest that a policy of universal PCV7 vaccination among infants in China would have a substantial positive public health impact on the population of China. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Swedish studies on antibiotic use in primary care have been based on one-week registrations of infections. In order to study adherence to guidelines, analyses based on large databases that provide information on diagnosis linked prescriptions, are needed. This study describes trends in management of infections in Swedish primary care particularly with regards to antibiotic prescribing and adherence to national guidelines. A descriptive study of Sweden's largest database regarding diagnosis linked antibiotic prescription data, the Primary care Record of Infections in Sweden (PRIS), for the years 2008, 2010 and 2013. Although the consultation rate for all infections remained around 30{\%} each year, antibiotic prescribing rates decreased significantly over the years from 53.7{\%} in 2008, to 45.5{\%} in 2010, to 38.6{\%} in 2013 (p = .032). The antibiotic prescribing rate for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) decreased from 40.5{\%} in 2008 to 24.9{\%} in 2013 while those for urinary tract infections and skin and soft tissue infections were unchanged. For most RTI diagnoses there was a decrease in prescription rate from 2008 to 2013, particularly for the age group 0–6 years. Phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV) was the antibiotic most often prescribed, followed by tetracycline. Tonsillitis and acute otitis media were the two RTI diagnoses with the highest number of prescriptions per 1000 patient years (PY). For these diagnoses an increase in adherence to national guidelines was seen, with regards to treatment frequency, choice of antibiotics and use of rapid antigen detection test. The frequency in antibiotic prescribing varied greatly between different Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCCs). Falling numbers of consultations and decreased antibiotic prescription rates for RTIs have reduced the antibiotic use in Swedish primary care substantially. Overprescribing of antibiotics could still be suspected due to large variability in prescribing frequency, especially for acute bronchitis and sinusitis. Continuous evaluation of diagnosis linked prescribing data and feedback to doctors is essential in order to achieve a more prudent antibiotic use.},

abstract = {Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been successfully used in infant vaccination programs. While most countries have used vaccination schedules with three primary immunisations and one booster dose, some countries have implemented schedules with only two primary immunisations and a booster dose. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence on immunogenicity of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in infants comparing two and three primary immunisations before a booster dose is given. We systematically reviewed papers published between 1999 and 2011. Results from individual studies were pooled in a meta-analysis with the difference in proportion of children achieving serotype-specific ELISA antibody levels of ≥0.35 $\mu$g/ml. We estimated that about 10{\%} less children achieve ELISA antibody levels of ≥0.35 $\mu$g/ml after two primary immunisations compared to three primary immunisations for most of serotypes included in one of the licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. This difference in proportion was higher for serotypes 6B and 23F, where -49.4{\%} (-66.0; -32.9{\%}) and -26.9{\%} (-37.2{\%}; -16.6{\%}) less children achieved protective antibody levels. These results support the notion that the majority of children are protected by two primary immunisations with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the first year of life. However, for serotypes 6B and 23F protection may be reduced. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The methods that have been used to estimate the clinical and economic impact of vaccination programmes are not always uniform, which makes it difficult to compare results between economic analyses. Furthermore, the relative efficiency of vaccination programmes can be sensitive to some of the more controversial aspects covered by general guidelines for the economic evaluation of healthcare programmes, such as discounting of health gains and the treatment of future unrelated costs. In view of this, we interpret some aspects of these guidelines with respect to vaccination and offer recommendations for future analyses. These recommendations include more transparency and validation, more careful choice of models (tailored to the infection and the target groups), more extensive sensitivity analyses, and for all economic evaluations (also nonvaccine related) to be in better accordance with general guidelines. We use these recommendations to interpret the evidence provided by economic evaluation applied to viral hepatitis vaccination. We conclude that universal hepatitis B vaccination (of neonates, infants or adolescents) seems to be the most optimal strategy worldwide, except in the few areas of very low endemicity, where the evidence to enable a choice between selective and universal vaccination remains inconclusive. While targeted hepatitis A vaccination seems economically unattractive, universal hepatitis A vaccination strategies have not yet been sufficiently investigated to draw general conclusions.},

abstract = {To determine the impact of initial antimicrobial choice on 30-day mortality rate in patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (CAP-SP), a prospective, observational study was conducted in 35 Spanish hospitals. A total of 638 patients with CAP-SP were identified. Antimicrobials were chosen by the attending physician. Patients were grouped into the following categories: beta-lactam monotherapy (n = 251), macrolide monotherapy (n = 37), beta-lactam plus macrolide (n = 198), levofloxacin alone/combination (n = 48), and other combinations (n = 104). The reference category was beta-lactam+macrolide. The 30-day survival probability was 84.9{\%}. Using multivariate survival analysis, factors related to mortality in the entire population were: bilateral disease, suspected aspiration, shock, HIV infection, renal failure and pneumonia severity index (PSI) score Class IV versus I-III and categories V versus I-III. The association of beta-lactams+macrolides was not better than the use of beta-lactams alone. The current authors analysed the different groups of patients with significant mortality/morbidity: intensive care unit, PSI Class {\textgreater}III, renal failure, chronic lung disease and bacteraemia. Only in patients with PSI Class {\textgreater}III, who had undergone initial antimicrobial choice classified as other combinations, were associated with higher mortality. In conclusion, the current authors have not demonstrated an independent association between initial antimicrobial regimen and 30-day mortality in community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia patients, except for those with a higher pneumonia severity index score.},

abstract = {Vaccination with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has significantly reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease and has had an important public health benefit. Because this vaccine targets only seven of the more than 92 pneumococcal serotypes, concerns have been raised that non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination. Indeed, among asymptomatic carriers, the prevalence of NVTs has increased substantially, and consequently, there has been little or no net change in the bacterial carriage prevalence. In many populations, pneumococcal disease caused by NVT has increased, but in most cases this increase has been less than the increase in NVT carriage. We review the evidence for serotype replacement in carriage and disease, and address the surveillance biases that might affect these findings. We then discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between near-complete replacement in carriage and partial replacement for disease, including differences in invasiveness between vaccine serotypes. We contend that the magnitude of serotype replacement in disease can be attributed, in part, to a combination of lower invasiveness of the replacing serotypes, biases in the pre-vaccine carriage data (unmasking), and biases in the disease surveillance systems that could underestimate the true amount of replacement. We conclude by discussing the future potential for serotype replacement in disease and the need for continuing surveillance.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION In Denmark, grommet insertion in the tympanic membrane is the most frequent type of surgery carried out on children. Denmark has a higher registered incidence of grommet treatment than the countries with which we normally compare ourselves. It is therefore relevant to study whether ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists follow grommet treatment guidelines, and which children are treated with grommets. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was planned as an observational survey with the individual child as observational unit for patient data. The ENT specialist was the observational unit for doctor behaviour. Data were collected in a double questionnaire study in which two questionnaires were completed by the ENT specialist and another two by the parents of each individual child. RESULTS A total of 24 ENT specialists participated, and they included 426 children in the study. The majority of the children were observed between three and six months prior to surgery. In 32{\%} (28-37{\%}) of the cases, the specialist had no information describing how long the GP had observed the child. A total of 95{\%} (92-97{\%}) of the parents were satisfied with the grommet treatment and estimated that it had considerably improved the child's and the family's daily lives. CONCLUSION The specialists followed the grommet treatment guidelines. Communication between specialists and GPs could be improved. Parents were satisfied with the treatment.},

abstract = {The prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci (PRP) has been increasing, with the highest levels reported from countries with relatively unrestricted antimicrobial use. It has been low in northern Europe except Iceland, which is disconcerting as antimicrobial use in Iceland has been relatively restricted. This suggests that other factors may facilitate their spread. By studying their epidemiology and possible risk factors for carriage, we have attempted to explain their rapid spread in Iceland. The incidence of infections caused by PRP (as percentage of infections considered due to pneumococci) has increased from 0{\%} in 1988 to 2.3{\%} in 1989, 2.7{\%} in 1990, 8.4{\%} in 1991, 16.3{\%} in 1992, and 19.8{\%} in 1993. The infections have mainly affected 0- to 3-year-old children (71.4{\%}), and the PRP belonged almost exclusively to serogroups 6, 19, and 23 (98.8{\%}). Most were serotype 6B multiresistant (75{\%}; resistant to penicillin (MIC = 1.0), cephalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim), and believed to belong to a single clone originating from Spain. The PRP have been prevalent in healthy children, 0-10{\%} nasopharyngeal carriage, especially in day-care centers, with the highest prevalence in areas that had the highest antimicrobial consumption. Recent antimicrobial consumption, especially of trimethoprim-sulfa, appeared to increase PRP carriage. The rapid spread of PRP in Iceland may have been facilitated by high antimicrobial consumption in day-care centers (especially of trimethoprim-sulfa) which are attended by the majority of Icelandic children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. One strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions but to advise delay in the hope symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007 and updated in 2010. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the use of delayed antibiotics compared to immediate or no antibiotics as a prescribing strategy for ARTIs. We evaluated clinical outcomes including duration and severity measures for pain, malaise, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea in sore throat, acute otitis media, bronchitis (cough) and the common cold. We also evaluated the outcomes of antibiotic use, patient satisfaction, antibiotic resistance and re-consultation rates and use of alternative therapies. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register; Ovid MEDLINE (January 1966 to February Week 3 2013); Ovid MEDLINE In-Process {\&} Other Non-Indexed Citations (28 February 2013); EMBASE (1990 to 2013 Week 08); Science Citation Index - Web of Science (2007 to May 2012) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 28 February 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants of all ages defined as having an ARTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to antibiotics used immediately or no antibiotics. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Three review authors independently extracted and collected data. Important adverse effects, including adverse effects of antibiotics and complications of disease, were included as secondary outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information where available. MAIN RESULTS Ten studies, with a total of 3157 participants, were included in this review. Heterogeneity of the 10 included studies and their results generally precluded meta-analysis with patient satisfaction being an exception.There was no difference between delayed, immediate and no prescribed antibiotics for the clinical outcomes evaluated in cough and common cold. In patients with acute otitis media (AOM) and sore throat immediate antibiotics were more effective than delayed for fever, pain and malaise in some studies. There were only minor differences in adverse effects with no significant difference in complication rates.Delayed antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics. A strategy of no antibiotics resulted in least antibiotic use.Patient satisfaction favoured immediate antibiotics over delayed (odds ratio (OR) 0.52; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.76). Delayed and no antibiotics had similar satisfaction rates with both strategies achieving over 80{\%} satisfaction (OR 1.44; 95{\%} CI 0.99 to 2.10).There was no difference in re-consultation rates for immediate and delayed groups.None of the included studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Most clinical outcomes show no difference between strategies. Delay slightly reduces patient satisfaction compared to immediate antibiotics (87{\%} versus 92{\%}) but not compared to none (87{\%} versus 83{\%}). In patients with respiratory infections where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use, while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delayed antibiotics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community-wide use of conjugated heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) in children {\textless}2 years of age could affect the microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) in vaccinees, particularly for penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP). SETTING: Since Summer 2000, 94{\%} of young children cared for by this 7-clinician, pediatric practice in rural central Kentucky received 3 or 4 doses of PCV7 in the first 18 months of life. OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in microbiology of AOM before and after community-wide routine implementation of PCV7. METHODS: Among children 7-24 months old with severe or refractory AOM, we compared 336 AOM isolates from 1992-1998 with 83 AOM isolates from 2000-2003 in children who had received 3 or 4 doses of PCV7. RESULTS: Comparing each cohort (1992-1998 versus 2000-2003), the proportion of S. pneumoniae decreased from 48{\%} to 31{\%} (P = 0.009; relative risk, 0.754; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.628-0.906), and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae increased from 41{\%} to 56{\%} (P = 0.01; relative risk, 1.87; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.15-3.04; beta-lactamase-positive, 56{\%} versus 64{\%}, not significant). The proportions of intermediate PNSP and resistant PNSP, respectively, were 16{\%} and 9{\%} versus 13{\%} and 6{\%} pre- and post-PCV7, respectively. Vaccine and vaccine-related serotypes, respectively, comprised 70{\%} and 8{\%} versus 36{\%} and 32{\%} of S. pneumoniae strains (P = 0.003). Post-PCV7, Gram-negative bacteria and beta-lactamase-producing organisms accounted for two-thirds and one-half of all AOM isolates, respectively. DISCUSSION: The overall proportion of S. pneumoniae isolates and vaccine serotypes in AOM were significantly reduced by community-wide use of PCV7 vaccine in our practice. The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria became 2-fold more frequent than S. pneumoniae in AOM in PCV7-vaccinated young children where PCV7 uptake was community-wide and supply was adequate.},

abstract = {In a prospective study, 36 (35{\%}) of 103 patients had early recurrence of acute otitis media. We wished to identify risk factors for early recurrences (those recurring within 1 month of initial diagnosis) and to determine if the second episode was caused by the same pathogen (relapse) or a new organism (reinfection). When the same bacterial species was recovered in both episodes, Streptococcus pneumoniae were serotyped and Haemophilus influenzae were classified by biotypes and by electrophoretic pattern of the outer membrane proteins. Twenty-nine patients underwent tympanocentesis at the time of the recurrent episode. In 13, no pathogen was recovered either initially or at the time of recurrence. Twelve (75{\%}) of the remaining 16 patients had reinfection; only four (25{\%}) had relapse. Thus, early recurrences of acute otitis media were more often caused by a new organism. This finding suggests that underlying susceptibility to middle ear infection is important in the development of recurrent otitis media. Pediatricians should not assume that early recurrences are necessarily the result of failure of initial treatment. Tympanocentesis may be helpful in this setting to aid in choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy.},

abstract = {Guidelines for economic evaluations insist that the sensitivity of model results to alternative parameter values should be thoroughly explored. However, differences in model construction and analytical choices (such as the choice of a cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit framework) also introduce uncertainty in results, though these are rarely subjected to a thorough sensitivity analysis. In this article, the authors quantify the effect of model, methodological, and parameter uncertainty, taking varicella vaccination as an example. They used 3 different models (a static model, a dynamic model that only looks at the effect of vaccination on varicella, and a dynamic model that also assesses the implications of vaccination for zoster epidemiology) and 2 forms of analysis (cost-benefit and cost-utility). They also varied the discount rate and time frame of analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate the impact of parameter uncertainty. In their example, model and methodological choice had a profound effect on estimated cost-effectiveness, but parameter uncertainty played a relatively minor role. Under cost-utility analysis, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that there was a near certainty that vaccination dominates no vaccination, or the other way around, depending on model choice and perspective. Under cost-benefit analysis, vaccination always appeared to be attractive. Thus, the authors clearly show that model and methodological assumptions can have greater impact on results than parameter estimates, although sensitivity analyses are rarely performed on these sources of uncertainty.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in critically ill patients, even if they have not previously had diabetes. Whether the normalization of blood glucose levels with insulin therapy improves the prognosis for such patients is not known. METHODS We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study involving adults admitted to our surgical intensive care unit who were receiving mechanical ventilation. On admission, patients were randomly assigned to receive intensive insulin therapy (maintenance of blood glucose at a level between 80 and 110 mg per deciliter [4.4 and 6.1 mmol per liter]) or conventional treatment (infusion of insulin only if the blood glucose level exceeded 215 mg per deciliter [11.9 mmol per liter] and maintenance of glucose at a level between 180 and 200 mg per deciliter [10.0 and 11.1 mmol per liter]). RESULTS At 12 months, with a total of 1548 patients enrolled, intensive insulin therapy reduced mortality during intensive care from 8.0 percent with conventional treatment to 4.6 percent (P{\textless}0.04, with adjustment for sequential analyses). The benefit of intensive insulin therapy was attributable to its effect on mortality among patients who remained in the intensive care unit for more than five days (20.2 percent with conventional treatment, as compared with 10.6 percent with intensive insulin therapy, P=0.005). The greatest reduction in mortality involved deaths due to multiple-organ failure with a proven septic focus. Intensive insulin therapy also reduced overall in-hospital mortality by 34 percent, bloodstream infections by 46 percent, acute renal failure requiring dialysis or hemofiltration by 41 percent, the median number of red-cell transfusions by 50 percent, and critical-illness polyneuropathy by 44 percent, and patients receiving intensive therapy were less likely to require prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care. CONCLUSIONS Intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose at or below 110 mg per deciliter reduces morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients in the surgical intensive care unit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a well-recognized adverse reaction to oral penicillins. This review analyzed the literature to determine the incidence of AAD following amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and penicillin V oral therapy in pediatric clinical trials. METHODS An advanced search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase databases for articles in any language reporting the incidence of AAD following oral penicillin therapy for any indicated infection in children (0-17 years). The search was limited to clinical trials. Articles were excluded if treatment was related to chronic conditions, involved concomitant antimicrobials, or if the dose or number of patients was not specified. RESULTS Four hundred thirty-five articles relating to clinical trials were identified (307 from Embase; 128 from MEDLINE). Thirty-five articles reporting on 42 studies were included for analysis. The indications included acute otitis media, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and pneumonia. Thirty-three trials reported on amoxicillin/clavulanate, 6 on amoxicillin, and 3 on penicillin V. In total, the 42 trials included 7729 children who were treated with an oral penicillin. On average, 17.2{\%} had AAD. Data were pooled for each penicillin. The AAD incidence was 19.8{\%} for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 8.1{\%} for amoxicillin, and 1.2{\%} for penicillin V. The amoxicillin/clavulanate data were analyzed according to formulation: pooled-average. The incidence of ADD was 24.6{\%} for the 4:1 formulation, 12.8{\%} for the 7:1 formulation, 19.0{\%} for the 8:1 formulation, and 20.2{\%} for the 14:1 formulation. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate substantially increased incidence of AAD following use of amoxicillin/clavulanate, compared to use of amoxicillin and penicillin V, as well as varying AAD rates with diffierent amoxicillin/clavulanate formulations. These findings warrant consideration when prescribing. The underlying mechanisms of AAD in children remain unclear.},

We conducted this study to characterize children with OM due to mixed Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) infections (M-OM) and those with OM due to single, S. pneumoniae-only infections (S-OM) and to examine whether pneumococcal serotypes associated with M-OM differed from those associated with S-OM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In a 10-year prospective study in southern Israel, the clinical and demographic variables and pneumococcal serotypes associated with M-OM were compared to those associated with S-OM in children {\textless}3 years old.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: M-OM episodes were significantly more likely to be found in Bedouin children (for whom living conditions are crowded and colonization occurs during early life) and in older children with bilateral OM, recurrent OM, previous tympanocentesis, and lower body temperature, as well as during the winter, suggesting an association with recurrence/chronicity. M-OM was associated with pneumococcal serotypes most commonly carried by healthy children, whereas S-OM was associated with serotypes previously shown to have a higher disease potential.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: S-OM and M-OM differ clinically and epidemiologically, with overlapping characteristics. Our findings are in agreement with clinical and experimental reports associating respiratory tract biofilms and mixed infections with pneumococcal serotypes of lower virulence and higher capacity to colonize the nasopharynx in healthy individuals.},

abstract = {Background Although understanding the processes of care and medical outcomes for patients with community-acquired pneumonia is instrumental to improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of care for this illness, limited information is available on how physicians manage patients with this illness or on medical outcomes other than short-term mortality. Objectives To describe the processes of care and to assess a broad range of medical outcomes for ambulatory and hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods This prospective, observational study was conducted at 4 hospitals and 1 health maintenance organization in Pittsburgh, Pa, Boston, Mass, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Data were collected via patient interviews and reviews of medical records for 944 outpatients and 1343 inpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of community-acquired pneumonia. Processes of care and medical outcomes were assessed 30 days after presentation. Results Only 29.7{\%} of outpatients had 1 or more microbiologic tests performed, and only 5.7{\%} had an assigned microbiologic cause. Although 95.7{\%} of inpatients had 1 or more microbiologic tests performed, a cause was established in only 29.6{\%}. Six outpatients (0.6{\%}) died, and 3 of these deaths were pneumonia related. Of surviving outpatients, 8.0{\%} had 1 or more medical complications. At 30 days, 88.9{\%} (nonemployed) to 95.6{\%} (employed) of the surviving outpatients had returned to usual activities, yet 76.0{\%} of outpatients had 1 or more persisting pneumonia-related symptoms. Overall, 107 inpatients (8.0{\%}) died, and 81 of these deaths were pneumonia related. Most surviving inpatients (69.0{\%}) had 1 or more medical complications. At 30 days, 57.3{\%} (nonemployed) to 82.0{\%} (employed) of surviving inpatients had returned to usual activities, and 86.1{\%} had 1 or more persisting pneumonia-related symptoms. Conclusions In this study, conducted primarily at hospital sites with affiliated medical education training programs, virtually all outpatients and most inpatients had pneumonia of unknown cause. Although outpatients had an excellent prognosis, pneumonia-related symptoms often persisted at 30 days. Inpatients had substantial mortality, morbidity, and pneumonia-related symptoms at 30 days.},

METHODS This retrospective study included 6 winter respiratory viral seasons (2001-2007) in Intermountain Healthcare, an integrated health system in the Intermountain West, including Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Children {\textless}18 years of age who were hospitalized with either invasive pneumococcal disease in any Intermountain Healthcare facility or culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease at Primary Children's Medical Center were included. We analyzed the correlation between invasive pneumococcal disease and circulating respiratory viruses. RESULTS A total of 435 children with invasive pneumococcal disease and 203 with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease were hospitalized in an Intermountain Healthcare facility or Primary Children's Medical Center during the study period. During the same period, 6963 children with respiratory syncytial virus, 1860 with influenza virus, 1459 with parainfluenza virus, and 818 with adenoviruses were evaluated at Primary Children's Medical Center. A total of 253 children with human metapneumovirus were identified during the last 5 months of the study. There were correlations between invasive pneumococcal disease and seasonal respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus activity. The correlation with invasive pneumococcal disease was strong up to 4 weeks after respiratory syncytial virus activity. For influenza virus and human metapneumovirus, the correlations were strong at 2 weeks after activity of these viruses. Pneumonia was the most common clinical disease associated with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease, mostly attributable to serotypes 1, 19A, 3, and 7F. CONCLUSIONS In the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era, seasonal increases in respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus infections in children were associated with increased pediatric admissions with invasive pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia caused by nonvaccine serotypes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the association between resistance and outpatient antibiotic use, expressed as either DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) or packages per 1000 inhabitants per day (PID). METHODS: IMS Health data on outpatient penicillin and cephalosporin ($\beta$-lactam) and tetracycline, macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (TMLS) use, aggregated at the level of the active substance (WHO version 2011) expressed as DID and PID (2000-07) were linked to European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) data on proportions of penicillin-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP) and erythromycin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (ENSP) (2000-09). Combined data for 27 European countries were analysed with a generalized linear mixed model. Model fit for use in DID, PID or both and 0, 1 or 2 year time lags between use and resistance was assessed and predictions of resistance were made for decreasing use expressed as DID, PID or both. RESULTS: When exploring the association between $\beta$-lactam use and PNSP, the best model fit was obtained for use in PID without time lag. For the association between TMLS use and ENSP, the best model fit was obtained for use in both PID and DID with a 1 year time lag. PNSP and ENSP are predicted to decrease when use decreases in PID, but not when use decreases in DID. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between outpatient antibiotic use and resistance and predictions of resistance were inconsistent whether expressing antibiotic use as DID or PID. We recommend that data on antibiotic use be expressed as PID and that time lags between use and resistance be considered when exploring these associations.},

abstract = {Otitis media (OM) is the most common childhood illness for which medical advice is sought. Whilst the disease rarely results in death, there is a significant level of morbidity and economic burden on the community. Although the causes of OM are multifactoral, bacterial and viral infections are the single most important cause. Bacteria responsible for infections of the middle ear are predominantly, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antibiotics have been widely used to treat children who present to a medical clinic with OM. However, given the high prevalence of this disease and the increasing incidence of microbial resistance to antibiotics, there is a need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies such as vaccination. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination has produced disappointing results for effectiveness in preventing OM and there is evidence of an increased incidence of disease due to non-vaccine serotypes. An efficacious vaccine for bacterial OM would require combining protective protein antigens from all three causative bacteria. A combined bacterial–viral vaccine formulation would produce the most profound and sustained impact on reducing the global incidence of OM.},

A rapid increase followed, associated with expansion of a single multiresistant clone, Spain(6B)-2, peaking at 19.8{\%} in 1993. After interventions led to reduced antimicrobial use in children, the prevalence of PNSP decreased until 1995. The aim of this study was to follow the evolution of PNSP from 1995 to 2010, the period preceding the introduction of conjugated pneumococcal vaccines into the vaccination programme.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The laboratory at the Landspitali University Hospital serves ∼ 85{\%} of the Icelandic population. All pneumococci isolated from 1995 to 2010 (n = 13,937) were stored (-80 °C). Oxacillin-resistant isolates were serotyped and penicillin MICs were determined. Selected strains were genotyped by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 1995, the rate of PNSP was 24.2{\%}, declining to 13.6{\%} in 2001, and then increasing to 38.6{\%} in 2010. Similar changes were observed for resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline. In 1995, 60.7{\%} of PNSP were serotype 6B, mainly the Spain(6B)-2 clone, declining to 5.7{\%} in 2010. PNSP of serotype 19F rapidly increased after 2004 to comprise 85.8{\%} of all serogrouped PNSP in 2010, with most isolates belonging to a single multiresistant PFGE clone identified as sequence type (ST) 271 and ST1968, representing single- and double-locus variants of the international clone Taiwan(19F)-14, respectively. PNSP were most common among young children, from the nasopharynx, middle ear and lower respiratory tract.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of PNSP was dominated by two multiresistant clones. The second expanded rapidly when the first one was disappearing, causing higher antibiotic resistance rates among pneumococci than seen before in Iceland.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT—This study compares the effectiveness of the Pitt bacteremia score, the Charlson weighted index of comorbidity, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scoring systems for the prediction of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis using the retrospective observational method on 134 patients with ICU-acquired sepsis. The statistical analyses show several important findings. First, Pitt bacteremia score is significantly correlated with the APACHE II scoring system (correlation coefficient = 0.738,P G 0.001). Second, the APACHE II scoring system, the Pitt bacteremia score, and the Charlson weighted index of comorbidity are independently correlated with mortality. Third, the Pitt bacteremia score and the APACHE II scores are positively related to mortality in patients with ICUacquired sepsis. As the result of the analyses, the mortality rate in patients with sepsis in the ICU is better predicted with the Pitt bacteremia score because it provides better estimation of sensitivity and specificity than the APACHE II scoring system and the Charlson weighted index of comorbidity.},

Bacterial NPC after PHiD-CV vaccination was assessed in the second year of life.Open descriptive study of NPC reported for 414 subjects vaccinated at 3-5 and 12-15 months of age with PHiD-CV with or without prophylactic paracetamol (PP) compared to 336 age-matched PCV-na{\"{i}}ve controls. Carriage was assessed prior to and 1, 3, 7 and 12 months after PHiD-CV booster or MenACWY-TT control vaccination at 12-15 months of age.At each visit, carriage of VT was reduced by 22-35{\%} in PHiD-CV recipients. Vaccine efficacy across all visits was 21.7{\%} [95{\%} CI 2.6; 37.0] (26.8{\%} carriage in the PHiD-CV group versus 34.2{\%} in controls). Carriage rates of NVT tended to be higher in PHiD-CV recipients. Pre-booster, these findings were more pronounced when PP had not been administered. No substantial effect of PHiD-CV vaccination was observed on NPC of other bacterial pathogens including non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae.Primary and booster vaccination with PHiD-CV reduced NPC of VT in the second year of life and tended to slightly increase that of NVT in line with previous experience with the 7-valent PCV. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Currently there are three pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with different coverage of serotypes for use in children under one year. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines of 7, 10, and 13 valences in the Colombian EPI. Methods: A Markov model, which followed a cohort of children under one year to life expectancy, was developed. Parameters of occurrence and care costs were based on data from National Health System and literature review. PCV-7 is a dominated strategy. PCV-10 and PCV-13 were each compared to no vaccination or PCV-10 vaccination, respectively. A 2 + 1 schedule and a vaccination price of US{\$} 14.00, US{\$} 14.85 and US{\$} 16.34 per dose were assumed in the base case for PCV-7, -10, and PCV-13 vaccines. Results: Introduction of PCV-13 rather than PCV-10 increases the number of life years gained (LYG). From the societal perspective, in the 'competing choice' framework cost per LYG was US{\$} 1837 with PCV-10 and US{\$} 9514 with PCV-13, while PCV-7 is a dominated strategy. The ICER of PCV-13 is above the per capita Gross Domestic Product. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were influenced mainly by effectiveness against radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and AOM, vaccine price, and discount rate. Conclusion: Routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae in Colombia would be cost-effective with PCV-10, with ICER below the per-capita GDP, but its inclusion requires evaluating the budget impact. PCV-13 would prevent more disease and deaths with a higher LYG, but PCV-10 would save more cost to the healthcare system due its higher impact in the prevention of AOM. There is limitation in the clinical evidence of both strategies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe NP and AOM otopathogens during the time frame 2007 to 2009, 6 to 8 years after the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV7) in the United States and to compare nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization and acute otitis media (AOM) microbiology in children 6 to 36 months of age having first and second AOM episodes with children who are otitis prone. Methods: Prospectively, the microbiology of NP colonization and AOM episodes was determined in 120 children with absent or infrequent AOM episodes. NP samples were collected at 7 routine visits between 6 and 30 months of age and at the time of AOM. For first and subsequent AOM episodes, middle ear fluid (MEF) was obtained by tympanocentesis. Eighty otitis prone children were comparatively studied. All 200 children received age-appropriate doses of PCV7. Results: We found PCV7 serotypes were virtually absent: (0.9{\%} isolated from both NP and MEF) in both study groups. However, non-PCV7 serotypes replaced PCV serotypes such that the frequency of isolation of S. pneumoniae (Spn) was nearly equal to that of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). M. catarrhalis (Mcat) was less common and Staphy-lococcus aureus infrequent in the NP and MEF from the 2 groups. The proportion of Spn, NTHi and Mcat causing AOM was similar in children with first and second AOM episodes compared to otitis prone children. However, oxacillin-resistant Spn isolated from the NP and MEF was 19{\%} for the absent/infrequent and 58{\%} for the otitis prone groups, P Ͻ 0.0001. Beta-lactamase producing NTHi occurred more frequently in the otitis prone group, P ϭ 0.04. Conclusions: Six to 8 years after widespread use of PCV7, Spn strains expressing vaccine-type serotypes have virtually disappeared from the NP and MEF of vaccinated children. NP colonization and AOM has changed to non-PCV7 strains of Spn. NTHi continues to be a major AOM pathogen. The otopathogens in first and second AOM and in otitis prone children are very similar although Spn and NTHi are more often antibiotic resistant in the otitis prone.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We compared pneumonia and influenza death rates among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people with rates among Whites and examined geographic differences in pneumonia and influenza death rates for AI/AN persons. METHODS: We adjusted National Vital Statistics Surveillance mortality data for racial misclassification of AI/AN people through linkages with Indian Health Service (IHS) registration records. Pneumonia and influenza deaths were defined as those who died from 1990 through 1998 and 1999 through 2009 according to codes for pneumonia and influenza from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision, respectively. We limited the analysis to IHS Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties, and compared pneumonia and influenza death rates between AI/ANs and Whites by calculating rate ratios for the 2 periods. RESULTS: Compared with Whites, the pneumonia and influenza death rate for AI/AN persons in both periods was significantly higher. AI/AN populations in the Alaska, Northern Plains, and Southwest regions had rates more than 2 times higher than those of Whites. The pneumonia and influenza death rate for AI/AN populations decreased from 39.6 in 1999 to 2003 to 33.9 in 2004 to 2009. CONCLUSIONS: Although progress has been made in reducing pneumonia and influenza mortality, disparities between AI/AN persons and Whites persist. Strategies to improve vaccination coverage and address risk factors that contribute to pneumonia and influenza mortality are needed.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading bacterial opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals. Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) of HIV-infected individuals reduces their risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), however, it remains 20- to 40-fold greater compared with age-matched general population. This review summarizes the available published data on the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines (PCV) in HIV-infected children and adults. Several studies have demonstrated that PCV are safe in the HIV-infected persons. Although PCV are immunogenic in HIV-infected infants, the antibodies produced are functionally impaired, there is possibly a lack or loss of anamnestic responses and immunity declines in later life However, quantitative and qualitative antibody responses to PCV in HIV-infected infants are enhanced when vaccination occurs whilst on ART, as well as if vaccination occurs when the CD4+ cell percentage is {\textgreater}/= 25{\%} and if the nadir CD4+ is {\textgreater} 15{\%}. Although the efficacy of PCV was lower, the vaccine preventable burden of hospitalization for IPD and clinical pneumonia were 18-fold and 9-fold greater, respectively, in HIV-infected children compared with -uninfected children. In HIV-infected adults, PCV vaccination induces more durable and functional antibody responses in individuals on ART at the time of vaccination than in ART-naive adults, independently of baseline CD4+ cell count, although there does not appear to be much benefit from a second-dose of PCV. PCV has also been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent IPD by 74{\%} in HIV-infected adults not on ART, albeit, also with subsequent decline in immunity and protection.},

abstract = {We aimed to study the excess health-care expenditures for persons with a known positive isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The data set was compiled by linking the database of the largest Belgian Sickness Fund with data obtained from laboratories reporting pneumococcal isolates. We analyzed the age-specific per-patient cumulative costs over time, using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). The mean structure was described by fractional polynomials. The quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion was used to compare different correlation structures. We show for all age groups that the health-care costs incurred by diagnosed pneumococcal patients are significantly larger than those incurred by undiagnosed matched persons. This is not only the case at the time of diagnosis but also long before and after the time of diagnosis. These findings can be informative for the current debate on unrelated costs in health economic evaluation, and GEEs could be used to estimate these costs for other diseases. Finally, these results can be used to inform policy on the expected budget impact of preventing pneumococcal infections.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory infection that is highly prevalent in infants, particularly those with underlying medical condi-tions. Severe cases of RSV require hospitalisation as well as admission to intensive care and may even result in death. The objective of the study was to measure the net benefits that could arise from an immunisation programme of infants that may well eradicate RSV to a high degree and save the direct and indirect medical care costs from hos-pitalisation, morbidity and the gain from potential life-time earnings by reducing the probability of mortality. In this context, the majority of existing empirical investigations are based on data from clinical trials, and where relevant facts are not available, a series of strong assumptions is derived from the published literature, whereas in this study, for the first time, the hospital episode statistics database is used to calculate the cost-benefit ratios. The methodology of the analysis adopts a cost-benefit approach to assess the impact of the immunisation and whether it is beneficial to society. The underlying assumptions of the basic model are assessed by adopting a sensitivity analysis. The results show that a number of categories are cost-effective with the use of the passive drug, which means benefits by raising the life expectancy and quality as well as reducing the resource burden on society.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In recent years welfare in Denmark has increased which might be expected to reduce otitis media (OM) incidence. We examined the age-specific incidence of OM in a nation-wide cohort of children aged 0-7 years born in 1996-2003 (Danish National Birth Cohort, DNBC). Only selection was ability to understand and speak Danish. METHODS: Information of OM and ventilation tubes (VT) was collected through three maternal interviews at 6-month, 18-month and 7-years of age and based on this age-specific and cumulative incidence of OM was calculated. As different numbers of the total population answered the different interviews, the calculations are done with different denominators. The information in DNBC was validated against two population based registries containing information of VT insertions. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of OM at 7 years was 60.6{\%} (31,982/52,755). For children with OM, 16.2{\%} (7143/44194) had their first OM episodes between 0-6 months of age, 44.3{\%} (19579/44194) between 7-18 months, and 39.5{\%} (17472/44194) between 19 months and 7 years. Four or more OM episodes before 7 years were reported by 39.5{\%} (12620/31982) and by 64.0{\%} (2482/3881) of those who had their OM debut between 0-6 months; by 48.2{\%} (4998/10378) with debut between 7-18 months; and by 28.7{\%} (4996/17344) with debut between 19 months and 7 years. These figures are essentially unchanged from earlier figures from Denmark. VT insertion at least once was reported by 26,1{\%} in the 7-year interview. Assuming recordings in the Danish National Patient Registry to be gold standard, maternal self-reportings in DNBC of insertion of VT showed high sensitivity (96.4{\%}), specificity (98.2{\%}), and positive (94.8{\%}) and negative predictive values (98.8{\%}). CONCLUSION: OM affects nearly 2/3 of preschool children in Denmark despite reduction in known OM risk factors.},

In this study of all ages, among adult patients, results were similar to the overall population, with the majority of inappropriate prescribing relating to respiratory infections. We applied the same methodology to investigate rates of antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections in outpatient primary care clinics at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The results of our evaluation reflected comparable rates of inappropriate prescribing, but when stratified by teaching versus non-teaching primary care clinics, inappropriate prescribing was significantly higher in non-teaching clinics (17.6{\%} vs 44.0{\%}, p {\textless} .0001). Respiratory infection visits in non-teaching outpatient clinics may be a pragmatic target for antimicrobial stewardship programs.},

abstract = {The addition of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) to the routine immunization schedule in the United States for infants has produced a much more favorable impact on the incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) than anticipated. Because the serotypes included in PCV7 were those most frequently expressing antibiotic resistance in 2001, predictions were made that up to 98{\%} of pneumococcal AOM episodes would be caused by penicillin susceptible strains. However, recent studies have shown that the benefits of PCV7 are becoming eroded. Replacement serotypes of pneumococci have emerged, expressing polysaccharide capsules different from those included in PCV7, with increasing frequency. These replacement strains are coming to dominate in the nasopharynx and in AOM isolates (and in invasive disease). Expansion in the isolation of serotypes 3, 7F, 15B/C/F, 19A, 22F, 33F, and 38 has been described in various surveillance systems. Pneumococcal strains expressing non-PCV7 capsular serotypes also appear to be rapidly acquiring resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics. Emergence of strains of pneumococci expressing non-PCV7 capsular serotypes is occurring by multiple mechanisms including capsular switching as suggested by molecular epidemiology studies. Expansion of the number of serotypes included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines is needed to sustain a long-term benefit from immunization against these bacteria.},

A life-table methodology was employed in the analysis. The cumulative incidence of the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age was 42.4{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 40.4-44.4) and the corresponding figure up to 24 months of age was 71.0{\%} (68.9-73.1). The incidence rate for all acute otitis media episodes was 0.93 episodes per child per year (0.90-0.96) during the first 24 months of life increasing in the spring and autumn. The risk of experiencing an episode of acute otitis media increased at the age of 6-12 months and decreased slowly during the second year of life. The results confirm the frequent nature of acute otitis media and stress the necessity for clear, consistent definition of the criteria for acute otitis media in epidemiological research.},

Nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of otopathogens in these children is compared with children without history of otitis media. METHODS Between May and November 2011, MEF and NP samples from 325 children aged {\textless}3 years were collected in three major centres in New Zealand at the time of ventilation tube insertion. An age-matched non-otitis-prone comparison group of 137 children had NP samples taken. A questionnaire was completed by both groups. RESULTS Immunisation coverage with at least one dose of PCV7 was 97{\%}. Haemophilus influenzae was cultured in 19.4{\%} of MEF and was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive in 43.4{\%}. S. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were cultured in {\textless}10{\%} of MEF samples but were PCR positive for 23.1{\%} and 38.7{\%}, respectively. H. influenzae was the most common organism isolated from NP samples (60{\%}) in the grommet group, while M. catarrhalis (56{\%}) was the most common in the non-otitis prone group. S. pneumoniae was more commonly found in the nasopharynx of children with ear disease (41{\%} vs. 29{\%}). 19F was the most prominent S. pneumoniae serotype in NP samples of both groups, but no serotype dominated in MEF. Ninety-five per cent of H. influenzae isolates were confirmed to be non-typeable H. influenzae. CONCLUSION In this cohort of children with established ear disease requiring surgical intervention, non-typeable H. influenzae is the dominant pathogen in both the nasopharynx and MEF.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the genetic diversity and patterns of the co-circulating genotypes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and their possible relationships with the severity of RSV infection, we studied all of the RSV-positive nasopharyngeal samples collected from children during five consecutive winters (2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014). The RSVs were detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and single-tube RT-PCR, their nucleotides were sequenced, and they were tested for positive selection. Of the 165 positive samples, 131 (79.4{\%}) carried RSV-A and 34 (20.6{\%}) RSV-B; both groups co-circulated in all of the study periods, with RSV-A predominating in all the seasons except for winter 2010-2011, which had a predominance of RSV-B. Phylogenetic analysis of the RSV-A sequences identified genotypes NA1 and ON1, the second replacing the first during the last two years of the study period. The RSV-B belonged to genotypes BA9 and BA10. BA9 was detected in all the years of the study whereas BA only desultorily. Comparison of the subjects infected by RSV-A and RSV-B types did not reveal any significant differences, but the children infected by genotype A/NA1 more frequently had lower respiratory tract infections (p{\textless}0.0001) and required hospitalisation (p = 0.007) more often than those infected by genotype A/ON1. These findings show that RSV has complex patterns of circulation characterised by the periodical replacement of the predominant genotypes, and indicate that the circulation and pathogenic role of the different RSV strains should be investigated as each may have a different impact on the host. A knowledge of the correlations between types, genotypes and disease severity may also be important in order to be able to include the more virulent strains in future vaccines.},

abstract = {The present study compares the molecular epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing invasive disease and carriage, respectively, in one geographic area (Stockholm, Sweden) during a specific point in time (the year 1997). A total of 273 invasive isolates (257 from adults and 16 from children) obtained from the 2 major hospitals in Stockholm, as well as 246 nasopharyngeal isolates recovered from children attending 16 day-care centers in the Stockholm area, were analyzed by serotyping, molecular typing (by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing), and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Of the 34 different serotypes plus nontypeable strains identified in the present study, 12 were never found among the 246 colonizing isolates, whereas only 3 were never found among the 273 invasive isolates. The isolates formed 2 major classes: 1 class that was found mainly among invasive isolates (type 1, 4, 7F, and 9V isolates) and was clonally highly related and 1 class that caused invasive disease but was also common in carriage (including type 6A, 6B, 14, and 19F isolates) and was genetically more diverse. Clones were found that belonged to the same serotype but had different abilities to cause invasive disease. Also, isolates belonging to the same clone were found, although they had different capsules because of serotype switch, and were found to have the same disease potential. Hence, properties associated with a particular clonal type, in addition to capsular serotype, are likely to be important for the potential of pneumococci to cause invasive disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the overall economic burden of pneumonia from an employer perspective. METHODS: The annual, per capita cost of pneumonia was determined for beneficiaries of a major employer by analyzing medical, pharmaceutical, and disability claims data. The incremental costs of 4036 patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia identified in a health claims database of a national Fortune 100 company were compared with a 10{\%} random sample of beneficiaries in the employer overall population. RESULTS: Total annual, per capita, employer costs were approximately 5 times higher for patients with pneumonia ({\$}11 544) than among typical beneficiaries in the employer overall population ({\$}2368). The increases in costs were for all components (eg, medical care, prescription drug, disability, and particularly for inpatient services). A small proportion (10{\%}) of pneumonia patients (almost all of whom were hospitalized) accounted for most (59{\%}) of the costs. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pneumonia present an important financial burden to employers. These patients use more medical care services, particularly inpatient services, than the average beneficiary in the employer overall population. In addition to direct health care costs related to medical utilization and the use of prescription drugs, indirect costs due to disability and absenteeism also contribute to the high cost of pneumonia to an employer.},

abstract = {Attempts to control pneumococcal infection by vaccination, undertaken initially in 1911, have gone through 3 phases during the subsequent 8 decades. Initially, vaccines of killed pneumococcal cells prepared in a variety of ways were used in epidemic settings with inconclusive results, although administered to approximately 1 million recipients. The discovery that adults injected with small amounts of purified capsular polysaccharide developed antibodies to the homologous capsular type led to the trial of a tetravalent vaccine that showed conclusively its ability to prevent infection by the types represented in it. With the advent of penicillin and other effective antipneumococcal drugs, interest in prophylaxis waned. Interest in vaccination was revived only after demonstration that some segments of the population remained at high risk of death if infected and after the emergence of multidrug-resistant pneumococci. Infants and young children, among whom the incidence of pneumococcal infection is high, respond poorly to purified bacterial polysaccharides but develop satisfactory responses to bacterial polysaccharides when these are linked chemically to a protein. The early results of trials with such polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccines give promise that control of a significant portion of pneumococcal infection in the paediatric population will soon be feasible.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the drug prescription pattern in outpatient children. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify studies published between 1994 and 2008 evaluating drug prescriptions to outpatient children. RESULTS: A total of 128 drug utilisation studies were identified, 107 of which were focused on a specific drug class, in particular psychotropic drugs (49 studies) and antibiotics (32 studies). The 21 studies that evaluated all drug prescriptions involved 21 countries, mainly from Europe (13 studies). Large differences were found between studies concerning data source, sample size and age range. A prevalence ranging from 51{\%} in Denmark to 70{\%} in Greenland and a prescription rate (number of drugs per children) ranging from 0.8 in Norway to 3.2 in the United States were reported in the 11 studies that monitored the overall paediatric population. The prevalence rate was higher in preschoolers, with a peak between 72 and 90{\%}, and decreased in children {\textgreater}6 years. Antibiotics were the most prescribed drugs (20-33{\%} of the prescriptions) followed by antiasthmatics (10-25{\%}). According to the results of four studies comparable in terms of data source and children's age, the overall prevalence estimate was 60{\%}. CONCLUSION: A large heterogeneity was found between studies, making a comparative evaluation often difficult or incomplete. The epidemiological evaluation of drug use in children should therefore be improved, in particular in terms of methodological quality of studies, and prospective multinational collaborative studies aimed at collecting valid and comparable data should be performed to improve the rational use of drugs.},

To place the antibody results in context, in this paper we also report previously unpublished data on serotype-specific clinical vaccine efficacy from the main trial. In the sub-study, a single 2-4 ml venous blood specimen was collected from 212 Gambian children 4-6 weeks after the administration of a third dose of PCV-9 or placebo. IgG antibodies to pneumococcal serotype 1, 4, 5, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F polysaccharides were measured by ELISA. The proportions of infants with antibody concentrations above 0.2, 0.35 and 1.0 microg/ml, and the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies were substantially higher for each serotype in children who received three doses of PCV-9 than those in the placebo group. Among PCV-9 recipients, GMCs ranged between 2.61 and 11.09 microg/ml with the highest being against serotype 14 and the lowest against 9V polysaccharide. The estimated overall protective antibody level for all nine serotypes, based on the vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) of 77{\%} (95{\%} CI: 51, 90) observed in the trial, was 2.3 microg/ml (95{\%} CI: 1.0, 5.0).

abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are essential for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions, where the causal chain between the agent and the outcome is relatively short and simple and where results may be safely extrapolated to other settings. However, causal chains in public health interventions are complex, making RCT results subject to effect modification in different populations. Both the internal and external validity of RCT findings can be greatly enhanced by observational studies using adequacy or plausibility designs. For evaluating large-scale interventions, studies with plausibility designs are often the only feasible option and may provide valid evidence of impact. There is an urgent need to develop evaluation standards and protocols for use in circumstances where RCTs are not appropriate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) remains a serious burden of disease, especially in developing countries of Asia and Africa. It is estimated that it causes 200,000 deaths per year, mainly in children. S. Typhi is an obligate pathogen of humans and although it has a relatively complex life cycle with a long lived carrier state, the absence of non-human hosts suggests that well targeted control methods should have a major impact on disease. Newer control methods including new generations of vaccines offer hope but their implementation would benefit from quantitative models to guide the most cost effective strategies. This paper presents a quantitative model of Typhoid disease, immunity and transmission as a first step in that process.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A stochastic agent-based model has been developed that incorporates known features of the biology of typhoid including probability of infection, the consequences of infection, treatment options, acquisition and loss of immunity as a result of infection and vaccination, the development of the carrier state and the impact of environmental or behavioral factors on transmission. The model has been parameterized with values derived where possible from the literature and where this was not possible, feasible parameters space has been determined by sensitivity analyses, fitting the simulations to age distribution of field data. The model is able to adequately predict the age distribution of typhoid in two settings.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The modeling highlights the importance of variations in the exposure/resistance of infants and young children to infection in different settings, especially as this impacts on design of control programs; it predicts that naturally induced clinical and sterile immunity to typhoid is long lived and highlights the importance of the carrier state especially in areas of low transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Following the introduction of a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children in 2000, there has been a decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among both children and adults in the United States. We evaluated the hypothesis that the case-fatality and mortality rates for invasive pneumococcal disease have also decreased since 2000.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based outcome study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, during the period 1995-2007 that involved patients of all ages.

RESULTS: From 1 January 1995 through 31 December 2007, a total of 180 eligible cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were identified in Olmsted County. During the 13-year study period, the overall case-fatality rate for invasive pneumococcal disease decreased from 19{\%} (14 of 74 cases) in 1995-1999 to 5{\%} (5 of 91 cases) in 2001-2007, an 83{\%} decrease, after adjustment for age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index score (P =.003). The largest decreases in case-fatality rate were seen among adults aged {\textgreater}/=65 years (an 86{\%} decrease, from 31{\%} [9 of 29 cases] to 8{\%} [3 of 40 cases]; P=.02) and patients with invasive pneumonia (a 78{\%} decrease, from 22{\%} [12 of 55 cases] to 7{\%} [5 of 72 cases]; P=.01). The overall mortality rate for invasive pneumococcal disease decreased from 2.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years in 1995-1999 to 0.7 deaths per 100,000 person-years in 2001-2007, a 78{\%} decrease, after adjustment for age and sex in a Poisson regression model (P=.002).

CONCLUSIONS: Significant decreases in the case-fatality and mortality rates for invasive pneumococcal disease were demonstrated in the population of Olmsted County. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings in other populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced replacement by nonvaccine serotypes in pneumococcal colonization and disease poses a threat to the long-term effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination. One of the main drivers for serotype replacement is likely to be the competitive interactions between pneumococcal serotypes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used longitudinal datasets of pneumococcal colonization among infants (American Indian and The Gambia) and toddlers (Denmark) to study the strength and mechanism of competition between pneumococcal serotypes. We characterized the strength of competition as the relative reduction in the expected time spent colonized with two serotypes (double colonization) as compared with colonization with no competition. We also assessed the mechanism of competition, that is, whether reduction in double colonization is due to reduced rate of acquisition or enhanced clearance of colonization. The three datasets were analyzed assuming both perfect (100{\%}) and imperfect (50{\%}) sensitivity in detection of double colonization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Each dataset showed strong between-serotype competition, and competition in acquisition was clearly identified. These findings remained in the secondary analysis assuming only 50{\%} sensitivity to detect double colonization. Inferences about enhanced clearance due to competition were susceptible to the assumed sensitivity of detection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Strong competition between pneumococcal serotypes can explain the prompt replacement by the nonvaccine serotypes in vaccinated persons and populations. The main mechanism of between-serotype interaction was identified as competition in acquisition, which suggests that replacement in pneumococcal disease depends largely on propensities of the replacing serotypes to cause disease through acquisition of colonization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Before 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) implementation in France, several studies had described the microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) treatment failures. The causative pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) followed by nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of pathogens involved in AOM treatment failures or recurrences. METHODS This French multicentric prospective study enrolled 143 children with AOM treatment failure between 2007 and 2009 observed by 8 ear, nose, and throat specialists. Failure was defined as the persistence of AOM symptoms after at least 48 hours of antibiotic therapy or their recurrence within 4 days after the end of treatment. Standardized history and physical examination findings were recorded, and culture of middle ear fluid (MEF) was obtained. RESULTS Mean age was 16.9 ± 9.9 months (median, 13.7). Eighty-eight percent of children had received more than 1 dose of PCV7, and 70.6{\%} attended day care. The most common antibiotic used at the time of treatment failure or recurrence was a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate (51.1{\%}). Bacteriologic sampling demonstrated that in 35{\%} of cases (n=50), no otopathogen was cultured at the time of treatment failure or recurrence. Similar proportions of Sp and NTHi were observed in the 86 patients (60.1{\%}) from whom only a single species was recovered from MEF (46.5{\%} for Sp, n=40 and 45.3{\%} for NTHi, n=39). Among Sp strains, 4.4{\%} were penicillin susceptible, 77.8{\%} were penicillin intermediate, and 17.8{\%} were fully penicillin resistant, and serotype 19A represented 84.5{\%} of all serotypes detected. Among NTHi isolates, 15.5{\%} (n=7) were $\beta$-lactamase-producing strains (including 2 strains with only this mechanism of resistance), and strains with reduced susceptibility by changes in protein binding to penicillin ($\beta$-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistant strains) represented 35.5{\%} of cases. Among the 50 sterile MEF samples, polymerase chain reaction was performed in 32, of which 4 were positive for HI, 3 for Sp, and 3 for both. CONCLUSIONS Among children with AOM treatment failures in France, Sp and NTHi were equally distributed; 19A was the main Sp serotype, and the main resistance mechanism for NTHi was $\beta$-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistance.},

A compartmental, static model with a 1-year time period for a steady-state population that allowed for the incorporation of direct and indirect (i.e., herd immunity and serotype replacement) vaccine effects across all age groups was used. Cases of disease prevented, deaths prevented, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and incremental costs in the steady-state year were calculated for PHiD-CV compared with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7). A short-term analysis was also conducted to estimate the incremental difference in disease and cost outcomes for the two vaccines within the first 10 years. All costs were in 2008 local currency. In all four countries, the model estimated that PHiD-CV prevented more cases of disease, prevented more deaths, and resulted in more life-years and quality-adjusted life-years compared with PCV-7 in both the short term and the steady-state year. Assuming price parity for the vaccines, the model projected that routine vaccination with PHiD-CV resulted in lower costs compared with PCV-7 in both the short term and the steady-state year. Scenario analysis showed the incremental cost savings for PHiD-CV compared with PCV-7 in the steady-state year were sensitive to assumptions regarding duration of vaccine efficacy.},

abstract = {Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have been introduced worldwide. However, few developing countries have high-quality surveillance systems available for monitoring vaccine impact. We evaluated whether data from nasopharyngeal carriage studies can be used to accurately monitor post-PCV changes in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among children under 5 years of age. For various dates during 1991-2010, data on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage and on IPD before and after administration of 7-valent PCV (PCV7) were available from England and Wales, the Netherlands, the Navajo and White Mountain Apache American Indian populations, and the US states of Massachusetts and Alaska. We estimated the change in carriage prevalence for each serotype in each study and then either calculated the average change (inverse variance-weighted) among vaccine and nonvaccine serotypes (model 1) or used mixed-effects models to estimate the change for each serotype individually, pooling serotype data within or between studies (models 2 and 3). We then multiplied these values by the proportion of IPD caused by each serotype during the pre-PCV7 period to obtain an estimate of post-PCV7 disease incidence. Model 1 accurately captured overall changes in IPD incidence following PCV7 introduction for most studies, while the more detailed models, models 2 and 3, were less accurate. Carriage data can be used in this simple model to estimate post-PCV changes in IPD incidence.},

abstract = {Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A ON1 genotype, first detected in 2010 in Ontario, Canada, has been documented in 21 countries to date. This study investigated persistence and transmission dynamics of ON1 by grouping 406 randomly selected RSV-positive specimens submitted to Public Health Ontario from August 2011 to August 2012; RSV-A-positive specimens were genotyped. We identified 370 RSV-A (181 NA1, 135 NA2, 51 ON1 3 GA5) and 36 RSV-B positive specimens. We aligned time-stamped second hypervariable region (330 bp) of G-gene sequence data (global, n = 483; and Ontario, n = 60) to evaluate transmission dynamics. Global data suggests that the most recent common ancestor of ON1 emerged during the 2008-2009 season. Mean evolutionary rate of the global ON1 was 4.10 × 10(-3) substitutions/site/year (95{\%} BCI 3.1-5.0 × 10(-3)), not significantly different to that of Ontario ON1. The estimated mean reproductive number (R0 = ∼ 1.01) from global and Ontario sequences showed no significant difference and implies stability among global RSV-A ON1. This study suggests that local epidemics exhibit similar underlying evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics to that of the persistent global RSV-A ON1 population. These findings underscore the importance of continual molecular surveillance of RSV in order to gain a better understanding of epidemics.},

Recent information suggests that Streptococcus pneumoniae, which colonize the nasopharynx asymptomatical-ly, can sense potentially " threatening " changes in the nasopha-ryngeal environment caused by virus infection by upregulating specific sets of genes involved in biofilm release, dissemination from the nasopharynx to other sites, and protection against the host immune system. Furthermore, an understanding of the transcriptional and proteomic changes occurring in bacteria dur-ing transition to infection has led to identification of novel vaccine targets that are disease-specific and will not affect asymptomatic colonization. This approach will avoid major changes in the delicate balance of microorganisms in the respi-ratory tract microbiome due to elimination of S. pneumoniae. Summary Our recent findings are reviewed in the context of the current literature on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of otitis media. We also discuss how other otopathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as the normal respiratory microbiome, can modulate the ability of pneumococci to cause infection. Furthermore, the unsatis-factory protection offered by the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines is highlighted and we review potential future strate-gies emerging to confer a more specific protection against otitis media. Otitis media (OM) comprises a heterogeneous group of in-flammatory disorders affecting the middle ear (ME). With over 700 million cases annually, OM is the most common reason for pediatric emergency room visits worldwide [1–3]. By the age of three, approximately 80{\%} of all children have experienced at least one episode of OM, while a large percent-age have had three or more, due to recurrent infection [4]. OM presents itself in several subtypes with acute or chronic elements that are classified based on symptoms (such as fever, irritability, pulling of the ear); visual appearance and/or perfo-ration of the tympanic membrane; and presence of ME fluid, with and without active inflammation [5]. Acute otitis media (AOM) generally affect children under the age of two and is characterized with sudden onset of symptoms, significant pain, and signs of inflammation with accumulation of purulent fluid behind the tympanic membrane. Based on new directives in several countries, including Sweden and parts of the USA, AOM in otherwise healthy children is usually treated with general analgesia, antipyretic drugs, and only for severe and recurrent cases with antibiotics. Despite this, OM is still a major reason for outpatient antibiotic prescription in the USA [2] and in many other parts of the world.},

Using a convenience sample (n=73), we tested self-evaluation and prospective diary surveys with a web-based interface, in order to obtain social contact data. The number of recorded contacts was significantly (P{\textless}0.01) greater on workdays (18.1) vs. weekend days (12.3) for conversations, and vice versa for touching (5.4 and 7.2 respectively). Mixing was highly assortative with age for both (adults contacting other adults vs. 0- to 5-year-olds, odds ratio 8.9-10.8). Respondents shared a closed environment significantly more often with {\textgreater}20 other adults than with {\textgreater}20 children. The difference in number of contacts per day was non-significant between self-evaluation and diary (P=0.619 for conversations, P=0.125 for touching). We conclude that self-evaluation could yield similar results to diary surveys for general or very recent mixing information. More detailed data could be collected by diary, at little effort to respondents.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective. Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tympanostomy tube insertion, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for any clinician involved in managing children, aged 6 months to 12 years, with tympanostomy tubes or being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting, as an intervention for otitis media of any type. Purpose. The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group broadly discussed indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with indwelling tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidance on surgical indications, the group focused on situations in which tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly regarding shared decision making and care of children with existing tubes. Action Statements. The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic eardrops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. The panel made recommendations that (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration; (2) clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) or prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who did not receive tympanostomy tubes until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (5) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (6) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; (9) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands; avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The development group provided the following options: (1) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and symptoms that are likely attributable to OME including, but not limited to, vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life and (2) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for 3 months or longer (chronic OME).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear') is common in childhood and surgical treatment with grommets (ventilation tubes) is widespread but controversial. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of grommet insertion compared with myringotomy or non-surgical treatment in children with OME. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Trials Register, other electronic databases and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (most recent search: 22 March 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of grommets. Outcomes studied included hearing level, duration of middle ear effusion, language and speech development, cognitive development, behaviour and adverse effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data from studies were extracted by two authors and checked by the other authors. MAIN RESULTS We included 10 trials (1728 participants). Some trials randomised children (grommets versus no grommets), others ears (grommet one ear only). The severity of OME in children varied between trials. Only one 'by child' study (MRC: TARGET) had particularly stringent audiometric entry criteria. No trial was identified that used long-term grommets.Grommets were mainly beneficial in the first six months by which time natural resolution lead to improved hearing in the non-surgically treated children also. Only one high quality trial that randomised children (N = 211) reported results at three months; the mean hearing level was 12 dB better (95{\%} CI 10 to 14 dB) in those treated with grommets as compared to the controls. Meta-analyses of three high quality trials (N = 523) showed a benefit of 4 dB (95{\%} CI 2 to 6 dB) at six to nine months. At 12 and 18 months follow up no differences in mean hearing levels were found.Data from three trials that randomised ears (N = 230 ears) showed similar effects to the trials that randomised children. At four to six months mean hearing level was 10 dB better in the grommet ear (95{\%} CI 5 to 16 dB), and at 7 to 12 months and 18 to 24 months was 6 dB (95{\%} CI 2 to 10 dB) and 5 dB (95{\%} CI 3 to 8 dB) dB better.No effect was found on language or speech development or for behaviour, cognitive or quality of life outcomes.Tympanosclerosis was seen in about a third of ears that received grommets. Otorrhoea was common in infants, but in older children (three to seven years) occurred in {\textless} 2{\%} of grommet ears over two years of follow up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In children with OME the effect of grommets on hearing, as measured by standard tests, appears small and diminishes after six to nine months by which time natural resolution also leads to improved hearing in the non-surgically treated children. No effect was found on other child outcomes but data on these were sparse. No study has been performed in children with established speech, language, learning or developmental problems so no conclusions can be made regarding treatment of such children.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care in Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden using European disease-specific antibiotic prescribing quality indicators (APQI) and taking into account the threshold to consult and national guidelines. DESIGN: A retrospective observational database study. SETTING: Routine primary health care registration networks in Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden. SUBJECTS: All consultations for one of seven acute infections [upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), sinusitis, tonsillitis, otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia and cystitis] and the antibiotic prescriptions in 2012 corresponding to these diagnoses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consultation incidences for these diagnoses and APQI values (a) the percentages of patients receiving an antibiotic per diagnosis, (b) the percentages prescribed first-choice antibiotics and (c) the percentages prescribed quinolones. RESULTS: The consultation incidence for respiratory tract infection was much higher in Belgium than in the Netherlands and Sweden. Most of the prescribing percentage indicators (a) were outside the recommended ranges, with Belgium deviating the most for URTI and bronchitis, Sweden for tonsillitis and the Netherlands for cystitis. The Netherlands and Sweden prescribed the recommended antibiotics (b) to a higher degree and the prescribing of quinolones exceeded the proposed range for most diagnoses (c) in Belgium. The interpretation of APQI was found to be dependent on the consultation incidences. High consultation incidences were associated with high antibiotic prescription rates. Taking into account the recommended treatments from national guidelines improved the results of the APQI values for sinusitis in the Netherlands and cystitis in Sweden. CONCLUSION: Quality assessment using European disease-specific APQI was feasible and their inter-country comparison can identify opportunities for quality improvement. Their interpretation, however, should take consultation incidences and national guidelines into account. Differences in registration quality might limit the comparison of diagnosis-linked data between countries, especially for conditions such as cystitis where patients do not always see a clinician before treatment. Key points The large variation in antibiotic use between European countries points towards quality differences in prescribing in primary care. * The European disease-specific antibiotic prescribing quality indicators (APQI) provide insight into antibiotic prescribing, but need further development, taking into account consultation incidences and country-specific guidelines. * The incidence of consultations for respiratory tract infections was almost twice as high in Belgium compared to the Netherlands and Sweden. * Comparison between countries of diagnosis-linked data were complicated by differences in data collection, especially for urinary tract infections.},

abstract = {The defined daily dose (DDD) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been the most frequently used unit of measurement to measure antibiotic use. However, measuring antibiotic use in paediatrics is a problem as the WHO DDD methodology is not applicable in children (aged {\textgreater}1 month) due to the large variation in body weight within this population. Based on the narrow range of body weights in the neonatal population, we therefore aimed to develop a set of neonatal DDDs for antibiotics. Eight well-respected (inter)national sources for dosage recommendations of antibiotics in children and neonates were consulted for the assumed maintenance dose of the ten most frequently used antibiotics in neonatal intensive care units in its main indication for neonates. A set of neonatal DDDs for ten commonly used antibiotics in neonates based on an assumed neonatal weight of 2 kg was proposed. Primarily in children DDDs are not applicable to quantify antibiotic use since there is large variation in body weight. In the neonatal population, however, based on its narrow range of body weights and when access to patient level data is not available, neonatal DDDs can be used as a unit of measurement.},
annote = {Prescribed packages per 1000 inhabitants was used as the unit of measure instead of the WHO recommended defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants. This was done primarily because DDD is an inaffective measure for a pediatric population. Several studies have found PPI to be a valid unit of measurement for this purpose.},

abstract = {Background Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 10 (PCV10) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV13), are used in childhood immunization programs worldwide, but direct comparisons of impacts against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in equivalent populations have not been performed. We compared the vaccines (prevaccination 2007-2009 vs postvaccination 2013-2016) in Sweden, where the 21 counties use either PCV10 or PCV13 (introduced 2009-2010). Methods All IPD episodes (n = 16992) were recorded in Sweden during 2005-2016. Of 14 186 isolates from 2007-2016, 13 468 (94.9{\%}) were characterized with serotyping and 12 235 (86.2{\%}) with antibiotic susceptibility. Poisson models assessed changes in incidence over time. Results Invasive pneumococcal disease incidences decreased between 2005 and 2016 in vaccinated children (by 68.5{\%}), and in the whole population (by 13.5{\%}), but not among the elderly (increased by 2{\%}) due to a substantial increase in nonvaccine types (NVTs). In 2016, NVTs constituted 72{\%} of IPD cases in the elderly. Serotype 6A declined in PCV10 and PCV13 counties, whereas serotype 19A increased in PCV10 counties. There was no effect against serotype 3. Cross-protection was found between 6B and 6A but not between 19F and 19A. Serotype 6C increased in PCV10 counties, but not in PCV13 counties, suggesting cross-protection with 6A, which is included in PCV13. In the elderly, the increase in NVTs, excluding 6C, was more pronounced in PCV13 counties. Conclusions The overall impact of IPD incidences was not statistically different irrespective of vaccine used. The incidence of serotypes, where the effect of the vaccines differed, will influence the cost-effectiveness of which vaccine to use in immunization programs. The dominance of NVTs suggests a limited effect of current pediatric PCVs against IPD in the elderly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Two new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were licensed to immunize infants and young children against pneumococcal disease. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to estimate the expected health benefits, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination with the 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable hemophilus influenza protein-D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) compared with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Sweden. METHODS A Markov cohort model was used to estimate the effect of vaccination at vaccine steady state, taking a societal perspective and using a 2+1 vaccination schedule. Price parity was assumed between the vaccines. Outcomes were measured by reduction in disease burden, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS The results predicted that PCV13 would prevent 3 additional cases of invasive pneumococcal disease and 34 additional cases of pneumonia, whereas PHiD-CV would avoid 3 additional cases of mastoiditis, 1010 tube insertions, and 10,420 cases of ambulatory acute otitis media compared with PCV13. By combining morbidity and mortality benefits of all clinical outcomes, PHiD-CV would generate 45.3 additional QALYs compared with PCV13 and generate savings of an estimated 62 million Swedish kronors. CONCLUSION The present study predicted lower costs and better health outcome (QALYs) gained by introducing PHiD-CV compared with PCV13 in routine vaccination. Our results indicated that PHiD-CV is cost-effective compared with PCV13 in Sweden.},

A 18-year and a 5-year time horizon were considered for the base-case and scenario analysis, respectively. PHiD-CV and PCV-13 are associated with the most important reduction of the clinical burden, with a potential marginal advantage of PHiD-CV over PCV-13. Compared with no vaccination, PHiD-CV is found on the higher limit of the usually indicated willingness to pay range (30,000 - 50,000euro/quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained), while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PCV-13 is slightly above. Compared with PCV-13, PHiD-CV would provide better health outcomes and reduce costs even at parity price, solely due to its differential effect on the incidence of NTHi acute otitis media (AOM). The analysis on a shorter time horizon confirms the direction of the base-case.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and antibiotic usage are common in children, increasing the risk of antibacterial resistance. The introduction of protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccines has led to reduction in pneumococcal infections. In 2011, pneumococcal protein-conjugated vaccine-10 was introduced into the national childhood vaccination in Iceland, a population not earlier vaccinated against pneumococcus, with 95{\%} vaccine uptake in the first year. The aim of the study was to evaluate the number of children visiting the Children's Hospital Iceland for RTIs before and after the introduction of the vaccine$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: : Admissions and visits to the Children's Hospital because of RTIs were recorded, and children aged 3 months to 2 years in the nonvaccine eligible cohort (born 2008-2010) were compared with the vaccine eligible cohort (born in 2011). Statistical analysis was done using large sample Z test and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significant reduction in incidence rate was found when comparing the nonvaccine eligible cohort with the vaccine eligible cohort, both for acute otitis media (AOM) (IRR: 0.76; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.67-0.87; P {\textless} 0.0001) and for pneumonia (IRR: 0.77; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.64-0.95; P {\textless} 0.01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A significant reduction in hospital visits because of AOM and pneumonia in children vaccinated with pneumococcal protein-conjugated vaccine-10 was established. The abrupt and significant reduction of AOM is unusually clear. This reduction was noted very early after initiation of the vaccination.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are a major global public health problem. Despite their importance, information on the burden of the different pneumococcal diseases is limited and estimates vary widely. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We critically reviewed the full economic evaluations (FEEs) on the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) conducted in the European Union (EU) to assess their potential contribution to public decision making. We selected the FEEs focussed on PCV-10 and PCV-13 and published in English from January 2007 until June 2013. We screened the selected articles to assess their main methodological features using a common checklist composed of epidemiological, clinical and economic items. RESULTS: All the ten studies selected were based on modelling and the time horizon was always long term. Two studies focused on adults, the remaining eight on infants. Only one study based herd immunity on national data, eight used foreign data or modelling and the last did not consider it. National prices and tariffs were claimed to be sources for unit costs in all studies; however, half of them assumed price parity when one vaccine was not yet marketed, and the figures varied within the countries where more than one study was conducted. Conclusions supported the economic utility of pneumococcal vaccination in all studies, raising some concern only in (i) the independent study, which found that PCV-13 was borderline cost effective, and (ii) the study sponsored by both manufacturers, which estimated an incremental ratio slightly above the national threshold for both PCV-10 and PCV-13. CONCLUSION: The European studies we analysed are mostly based on weak sources of data. Because of the limited information on vaccine effectiveness and lack of epidemiological and economic data, the need for extensive recourse to assumptions leads to great within- and between-study variability generated by authors' choices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Incidence, manifestations and case-fatality rate (CFR) of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) vary with age and comorbidities. New vaccines, changing age distribution, prolonged survival among immunocompromised patients and improved sepsis management have created a need for an update of basic facts to inform vaccine recommendations. METHODS Age, gender and comorbidities were related to manifestations and death for 2977 consecutive patients with IPD in a Swedish region with 1.5 million inhabitants during 13 years before introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in the infant vaccination program. These data were related to population statistics and prevalence of several comorbidities, and compared with two previous studies giving a total follow-up of 45 years in the same area. RESULTS The annual incidence was 15/100,000 for any IPD and 1.1/100,000 for meningitis; highest among elderly followed by children {\textless} 2 years. It was 2238/100,000 among myeloma patients, followed by chronic lymphatic leukemia, hemodialysis and lung cancer, but not elevated among asthma patients. CFR was 10 {\%} among all patients, varying from 3 {\%} below 18 years to 22 {\%} ≥ 80 years. During 45 years, the IPD incidence increased threefold and CFR dropped from 20 to 10 {\%}. Meningitis incidence remained stable (1.1/100,000/year) but CFR dropped from 33 to 13 {\%}. IPD-specific mortality decreased among children {\textless}2 years from 3.1 to 0.46/100,000/year but tripled among those ≥65 years. CONCLUSIONS IPD incidence and CFR vary widely between age and risk groups and over time even without general infant vaccination. Knowledge about specific epidemiological characteristics is important for informing and evaluating vaccination policies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to determine whether colchicine 0.5 mg/day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with clinically stable coronary disease. BACKGROUND The presence of activated neutrophils in culprit atherosclerotic plaques of patients with unstable coronary disease raises the possibility that inhibition of neutrophil function with colchicine may reduce the risk of plaque instability and thereby improve clinical outcomes in patients with stable coronary disease. METHODS In a clinical trial with a prospective, randomized, observer-blinded endpoint design, 532 patients with stable coronary disease receiving aspirin and/or clopidogrel (93{\%}) and statins (95{\%}) were randomly assigned colchicine 0.5 mg/day or no colchicine and followed for a median of 3 years. The primary outcome was the composite incidence of acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 15 of 282 patients (5.3{\%}) who received colchicine and 40 of 250 patients (16.0{\%}) assigned no colchicine (hazard ratio: 0.33; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.59; p {\textless} 0.001; number needed to treat: 11). In a pre-specified secondary on-treatment analysis that excluded 32 patients (11{\%}) assigned to colchicine who withdrew within 30 days due to intestinal intolerance and a further 7 patients (2{\%}) who did not start treatment, the primary outcome occurred in 4.5{\%} versus 16.0{\%} (hazard ratio: 0.29; 95{\%} CI: 0.15 to 0.56; p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Colchicine 0.5 mg/day administered in addition to statins and other standard secondary prevention therapies appeared effective for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary disease.},

abstract = {Objective: UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on surgical management of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children call for an initial 3 month period of observation, with ventilation tube (VT) insertion considered for children with persistent bilateral OME with a hearing level in better ear of 25-30. dB HL or worse (" core criteria"), or for children not meeting those audiologic criteria but when OME has significant impact on developmental, social or educational status (exceptional circumstances). We aimed to establish whether guidelines are followed and whether they have changed clinical practice. Methods: Retrospective case-notes review in five different centres, analysing practice in accordance with guidelines in all children having first VT insertion before (July-December 06) and after (July-December 08) guidelines introduction. Results: Records of 319 children were studied, 173 before and 146 after guidelines introduction. There were no significant differences in practice according to guidelines before and after their introduction with respect to having 2 audiograms 3 months apart (57.8 vs. 54.8{\%}), OME persisting at least 3 months (94.8 vs. 92.5{\%}), or fulfilment of the 25. dB audiometric criteria (68.2 vs. 61.0{\%}). Practice in accordance with the core criteria fell significantly from 43.9 to 32.2{\%} (Chi squared p=0.032). However, if the exceptional cases were included there was no significant difference (85.5 vs. 87.0{\%}), as the proportion of exceptional cases rose from 48.3 to 62.2{\%} (Chi squared p=0.021). Conclusion: This study shows that 87.0{\%} of children have VTs inserted in accordance with NICE guidelines providing exceptional cases are included, but only 32.2{\%} comply with the core criteria. A significant number have surgery due to the invoking of exceptional criteria, suggesting that clinicians are personalising the treatment to each individual child. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Otitis media (OM) is a leading cause of pediatric health care visits and the most frequent reason children consume antibiotics or undergo surgery. During recent years, several interventions have been introduced aiming to decrease OM burden. OBJECTIVE: To study the trend in OM-related health care use in the United States during the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) era (2001-2011). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An analysis of an insurance claims database of a large, nationwide managed health care plan was conducted. Enrolled children aged 6 years or younger with OM visits were identified. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual OM visit rates, OM-related complications, and surgical interventions were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 7.82 million unique children (5.51 million child-years) contributed 6.21 million primary OM visits; 52{\%} were boys and 48{\%} were younger than 2 years. There was a downward trend in OM visit rates from 2004 to 2011, with a significant drop that coincided with the advent of the 13-valent vaccine (PCV-13) in 2010. The observed OM visit rates in 2010 (1.00/child-year) and 2011 (0.81/child-year) were lower than the projected rates based on the 2005-2009 trend had there been no intervention (P {\textless} .001). Recurrent OM (≥3 OM visits within 6-month look-back) rates decreased at 0.003/child-year (95{\%} CI, 0.002-0.004/child-year) in 2001-2009 and at 0.018/child-year (95{\%} CI, 0.008-0.028/child-year) in 2010-2011. In the PCV-13 premarket years, there was a stable rate ratio (RR) between OM visit rates in children younger than 2 years and in those aged 2 to 6 years (RR, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.38-1.39); the RR decreased significantly (P {\textless} .001) during the transition year 2010 (RR 1.32; 95{\%} CI, 1.31-1.33) and the postmarket year 2011 (RR 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.02). Tympanic membrane perforation/otorrhea rates gradually increased (from 3721 per 100,000 OM child-years in 2001 to 4542 per 100,000 OM child-years in 2011; P {\textless} .001); the increase was significant only in the older children group. Mastoiditis rates substantially decreased (from 61 per 100,000 child-years in 2008 to 37 per 100,000 child-years in 2011; P {\textless} .001). Ventilating tube insertion rate decreased by 19{\%} from 2010 to 2011 (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was an overall downward trend in OM-related health care use from 2001 to 2011. The significant reduction in OM visit rates in 2010-2011 in children younger than 2 years coincided with the advent of PCV-13. Although tympanic membrane perforation/otorrhea rates steadily increased during that period, mastoiditis and ventilating tube insertion rates decreased in the last years of the study.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that following the introduction of PCV7, the exchange of vaccine serotypes (VST) for non-vaccine serotypes (NVST) in the nasopharynx has resulted in fewer episodes of pneumococcal acute otitis media (AOM) due to the reduced capacity for common NVST strains to cause disease. We modeled the change in the proportion of children colonized with S. pneumoniae who would develop pneumococcal AOM that would occur due to serotype replacement, and projected the future impact of PCV13. Our model is based on observed changes in the nasopharyngeal pneumococcal serotype distribution from the pre- to post-PCV7 era, and an estimated capacity of each serotype to produce pneumococcal AOM given colonization; the latter was derived by dividing serotype-specific disease prevalence by serotype-specific carriage prevalence in the same population. Our results indicate a 12{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.5-26) decline in the number of AOM episodes attributable to S. pneumoniae in children less than 3 years of age between 2000 and 2007 due to the combined effects of PCV7 vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced serotype replacement, and predicts that PCV13 will further decrease pneumococcal AOM an additional 27{\%} (95{\%} CI 13-40) from 2007 to 2013. Evaluation of changes in VST disease revealed a 91{\%} (95{\%} CI 83-97) decrease in PCV7-VST AOM from 2000 to 2007, and predicted an additional 65{\%} (95{\%} CI 57-74) decrease in PCV13-VST AOM from 2007 to 2013. Our model indicates that following vaccination, nasopharyngeal replacement of VST by NVST has led to a decrease in the amount of pneumococcal AOM despite a consistent rate of S. pneumoniae colonization, and that pneumococcal AOM may continue to decrease as pneumococcal serotypes with greater capacity to cause disease are replaced by less locally invasive serotypes.},

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) offers seroprotection against six additional serotypes. A decision-analytic model was constructed to estimate direct medical costs and clinical effectiveness of PCV13 vaccination on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia, and otitis media relative to PCV7 vaccination. The option with an one-dose catch-up vaccination in children of 15-59 months was also considered. Assuming 83{\%} vaccination coverage and considering indirect effects, 1808 IPD, 5558 pneumonia and 74,136 otitis media cases could be eliminated from the entire population during a 10-year modelling period. The PCV13 vaccination programme would lead to additional costs (+€26.2 Mio), but saved medical costs of -€77.1 Mio due to cases averted and deaths avoided, overcompensate these costs (total cost savings -€50.9 Mio). The national immunisation programmes with PCV13 can be assumed cost saving when compared with the current vaccine PCV7 in Switzerland.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of severe infectious diseases worldwide. This paper presents the results from the first European invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) enhanced surveillance where additional and valuable data were reported and analysed. Following its authorisation in Europe in 2001 for use in children aged between two months and five years, the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was progressively introduced in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries, albeit with different schemes and policies. In mid-2010 European countries started to switch to a higher valency vaccine (PCV10/PCV13), still without a significant impact by the time of this surveillance. Therefore, this surveillance provides an overview of baseline data from the transition period between the introduction of PCV7 and the implementation of PCV10/PCV13.In 2010, 26 EU/EEA countries reported 21 565 cases of IPD to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) applying the EU 2008 case definition. Serotype was determined in 9. 946/21. 565 (46.1{\%}) cases. The most common serotypes were 19A, 1, 7F, 3, 14, 22F, 8, 4, 12F and 19F, accounting for 5. 949/9. 946 (59.8{\%}) of the serotyped isolates. Data on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) in the form of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were submitted for penicillin 5. 384/21. 565 (25.0{\%}), erythromycin 4. 031/21. 565 (18.7{\%}) and cefotaxime 5. 252/21. 565 (24.4{\%}). Non-susceptibility to erythromycin was highest at 17.6{\%} followed by penicillin at 8.9{\%}.PCV7 serotype coverage among children {\textless}5 years in Europe, was 19.2{\%}; for the same age group, the serotype coverage for PCV10 and PCV13 were 46.1{\%} and 73.1{\%}, respectively.In the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the monitoring of changing trends in antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution are essential in assessing the impact of vaccines and antibiotic use control programmes across European countries. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cost effectiveness is becoming an increasingly important factor for stakeholders faced with decisions about adding a new vaccine into national immunization programmes versus alternative use of resources. Evaluating cost effectiveness, taking into account the relevant biological, clinical, epidemiological and economic factors of a vaccination programme, generally requires use of a model. This review examines the modelling approaches used in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of vaccination programmes.After overviewing the key attributes of models used in CEAs, a framework for categorising theoretical models is presented. Categories are based on three main attributes: static/dynamic; stochastic/deterministic; and aggregate/individual based. This framework was applied to a systematic review of CEAs of all currently available vaccines for the period of 1976 to May 2007. The systematic review identified 276 CEAs of vaccination programmes. The great majority (83{\%}) of CEAs were conducted in the setting of high-income countries. Only a few vaccines were widely studied, with 57{\%} of available CEAs being focused on the varicella, influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or pneumococcal vaccine. Several time trends were evident, indicating that the number of vaccine CEAs being published is increasing; the main health outcome measures are moving away from the number of cases prevented towards quality-adjusted and unadjusted life-years gained, and more complex models are beginning to be used. The modelling approach was often not adequately described. Of the 208 CEAs that could be categorized according to the framework, around 90{\%} were deterministic, aggregate-level static models. Although a dynamic transmission model is required to account for herd-immunity effects, only 23 of the CEAs were dynamic. None of the CEAs were individual based. To improve communication about the cost effectiveness of vaccination programmes, we believe the first step is for analysts to be more transparent with each other. A clear description of the model type using consistent terminology and justification for the model choice must begin to accompany all CEAs. As a minimum, we urge modellers to provide an explicit statement about the following attributes: static/dynamic; stochastic/deterministic; aggregate/individual based; open/closed. Where relevant, time intervals (discrete/continuous) and (non)linearity should also be described. Enhanced methods of assessing model performance and validity are also required. Our results emphasize the need to improve modelling methods for CEAs of vaccination programmes; specifically, model choice, construction, assessment and validation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of acute otitis media (AOM). Pneumococcal non-typable Haemophilus influenzae Protein D Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-10) was introduced to the Chilean national immunization program (NIP) in 2011. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of AOM in children {\textless} 24 months of age attending the Emergency Department (ED) of Hospital S{\'{o}}tero del R{\'{i}}o (HSR) 4 years before and 4 years after the introduction of PCV-10 in the Chilean NIP. METHODS Register-based nested case-control study. Cases (n = 1,907) were all children {\textless} 24 months of age with a clinical diagnosis discharge of AOM at the ED of HSR, and controls (n = 244,334) were all other children {\textless} 24 months of age attended at the same ED in the same time period, with any other discharge diagnosis. The data were obtained through HSR Statistical Service. RESULTS In the study period there was a mean of 30,695 children {\textless} 24 months managed each year at the ED of HSR. The percentage with AOM in the pre vaccine period was 0.94{\%} and in the post vaccine period was 0.62{\%}, respectively (P=0.026). Exposure to the PCV-10 was associated with a decreased risk to develop AOM in children {\textless} 24 months, with an OR of 0.659 [95{\%} CI 0.60-0.72]. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed a significant decrease in the percentage and risk of AOM in children {\textless} 24 months of age who visited the ED of HSR after implementation of PCV-10 in the NIP in Chile.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differences in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children are expected after a change from 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) to 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Universal vaccination with PCV7 started in Madrid in November 2006, and it switched to PCV13 in June 2010.

METHODS: A prospective, laboratory-confirmed (by culture or polymerase chain reaction), clinical surveillance including all pediatric IPD requiring hospitalization in Madrid was performed in all hospitals with a pediatric department and included four 1-year periods from May 2007 to April 2011. Incidence rate (IR) was calculated as number cases per 100,000 inhabitants using children population data.

RESULTS: Six hundred fourteen IPDs were identified: 209 parapneumonic pneumococcal empyema, 191 bacteremic pneumonia, 75 primary bacteremia, 72 meningitis, 38 IPDs secondary to otic foci and 29 others. The incidence of IPD remained unchanged during 2007-2010 (IR=≈17.0), with a marked decrease in 2010-2011 (IR=11.34; P{\textless}0.05) attributable to reduction in children younger than 24 months (50.19 in 2008-2009 compared with 24.92 in 2010-2011; P{\textless}0.005). The incidence of bacteremic pneumonia (R²=0.966; $\beta$=1.132; P=0.017) and meningitis (R²=0.898; $\beta$=0.505; P=0.052) showed decreasing linear trends over time. The incidence of parapneumonic pneumococcal empyema increased in 2009-2010 but decreased in 2010-2011 (6.73 vs. 4.14; P=0.019). The incidence of IPDs by PCV13 serotypes was significantly (P≤0.004) lower in 2010-2011 (8.78) than in previous periods (IR=≈13.5).

CONCLUSIONS: Early data regarding changing from PCV7 to PCV13 use in the childhood vaccination calendar indicate that reductions in IR of bacteremic pneumonia and meningitis after PCV7 introduction (by reduction of cases by serotypes 1 and 19A) further decreased and there was a reversion of the increase in IR of parapneumonic pneumococcal empyema from 2010-2011, mainly because of reduction in serotype 1 and 19A cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Interventions targeting individuals classified as "high-risk" have become common-place in health care. High-risk may represent outlier values on utilization, cost, or clinical measures. Typically, such individuals are invited to participate in an intervention intended to reduce their level of risk, and after a period of time, a follow-up measurement is taken. However, individuals initially identified by their outlier values will likely have lower values on re-measurement in the absence of an intervention. This statistical phenomenon is known as "regression to the mean" (RTM) and often leads to an inaccurate conclusion that the intervention caused the effect. Concerns about RTM are rarely raised in connection with most health care interventions, and it is uncommon to find evaluators who estimate its effect. This may be due to lack of awareness, cognitive biases that may cause people to systematically misinterpret RTM effects by creating (erroneous) explanations to account for it, or by design. METHODS In this paper, the author fully describes the RTM phenomenon, and tests the accuracy of the traditional approach in calculating RTM assuming normality, using normally distributed data from a Monte Carlo simulation and skewed data from a control group in a pre-post evaluation of a health intervention. Confidence intervals are generated around the traditional RTM calculation to provide more insight into the potential magnitude of the bias introduced by RTM. Finally, suggestions are offered for designing interventions and evaluations to mitigate the effects of RTM. RESULTS On multivariate normal data, the calculated RTM estimates are identical to true estimates. As expected, when using skewed data the calculated method underestimated the true RTM effect. Confidence intervals provide helpful guidance on the magnitude of the RTM effect. CONCLUSION Decision-makers should always consider RTM to be a viable explanation of the observed change in an outcome in a pre-post study, and evaluators of health care initiatives should always take the appropriate steps to estimate the magnitude of the effect and control for it when possible. Regardless of the cause, failure to address RTM may result in wasteful pursuit of ineffective interventions, both at the organizational level and at the policy level.},

abstract = {The synthetic control (SC) model is a powerful tool to quantify the population-level impact of vaccines, because it can adjust for trends unrelated to vaccination using a composite of control diseases. Because vaccine impact studies are often conducted using smaller subnational datasets, we evaluated the performance of SC models with sparse time series data. To obtain more robust estimates of vaccine effects from noisy time series, we proposed a possible alternative approach, "STL+PCA" method (seasonal-trend decomposition plus principal component analysis), which first extracts smoothed trends from the control time series and uses them to adjust the outcome. Using both the SC and STL+PCA models, we estimated the impact of 10-valent pneuomococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) on pneumonia hospitalizations among cases {\textless}12 months and 80+ years of age during 2004-2014 at the subnational level in Brazil. The performance of these models was also compared using simulation analyses. The SC model was able to adjust for trends unrelated to PCV10 in larger starts but not in smaller states. The simulation analyses confirmed that the SC model failed to select an appropriate set of control diseases when the time series were sparse and noisy, thereby generating biased estimates of the impact of vaccination when secular trends were present. The STL+PCA approach decreased bias in the estimates for smaller populations. Estimates from the SC model might be biased when data are sparse. The STL+PCA model provides more accurate evaluations of vaccine impact in smaller populations.},

After broth enrichment, samples were cultured for SP and isolates were serotyped. Clinical and immunization records were reviewed. Findings during 6 sequential 6-month study periods were compared. Surveillance isolates of invasive disease isolates were reviewed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 2048 children were enrolled, and 656 (32{\%}) were SP carriers. Mean age of carriers was 27 months, 54{\%} were males. Carriage was higher among day-care attendees (P {\textless} 0.01) and children with respiratory tract illnesses (P {\textless} 0.5) and otitis media (P {\textless} 0.01). Commonly carried serotypes included 35B (15.2{\%}), 15B/C (14.2{\%}), 19A (9.6{\%}), 11A (8{\%}), 23B (5.6{\%}), 6C (5.3{\%}), 21 (5{\%}), and 15A (5{\%}); 13.9{\%} were PCV13 serotypes.

Among carriers, PCV13 serotypes declined from 29{\%} (36/124) to 3{\%} (3/99; P {\textless} 0.0001), predominantly because of decline of serotype 19A from 25.8{\%} (32/124) to 3{\%} (3/99; P {\textless} 0.0001); non-PCV13 serotypes (excluding 6C) increased from 68.4{\%} (78/114) to 97{\%} (95/98; P {\textless} 0.0001); serotype 35B significantly increased from 8.9{\%} (11/124) to 25.3{\%} (25/99; P {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56{\%} in the Netherlands to 95{\%} in the USA, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 to April 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60{\%} of the children had recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95{\%} CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95{\%} CI 0.63 to 0.91; NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95{\%} CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95{\%} CI 0.74 to 0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95{\%} CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95{\%} CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95{\%} CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95{\%} CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95{\%} CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95{\%} CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea.For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95{\%} CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95{\%} CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9).Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 3). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: In April 2010 the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was replaced by the 13-valent PCV. We investigated pneumococcal carriage in children eligible for PCV7 or PCV13 and their household contacts. METHODS: Eligible families in Hertfordshire and Gloucester were identified and a nasopharyngeal swab obtained from consenting household members between July 2012 and March 2013. Samples were cultured for Streptococcus pneumoniae and serotyped by standard methods. For each serotype the ratio of its prevalence in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) to its carriage prevalence (case:carrier ratio, CCR) was calculated. Results were compared with previous carriage studies in 2001/2002 and 2008/2009, before and after PCV7 introduction. RESULTS: 217 households were included. Among {\textless}5-year olds 47.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 41.8-53.5) were carrying a pneumococcus compared with 51.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 44.0-58.0) in 2008/2009 and 48.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 44.1-52.7) in 2001/2002. The odds of carrying a PCV7 serotype was significantly reduced in 2008/2009 (0.07, 95{\%} CI: 0.03-0.16) and 2012/2013 (0.01 95{\%} CI: 0.00-0.07) relative to 2001/2002, while the odds of carrying any of the extra six PCV13 serotypes increased after PCV7 introduction (1.38, 95{\%}CI: 0.73-2.59) but declined significantly after PCV13 introduction (0.05, 95{\%}CI: 0.01-0.37). The CCRs for the frequently carried serotypes were relatively low, with the highest CCR observed for serotypes 7F, 19A, 3, 8, and 33F. Across the three carriage studies, CCR estimates were stable for nearly all serotypes. CONCLUSION: Carriage of additional PCV13 serotypes has rapidly reduced post-PCV13 introduction in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with a continued decline in transmission of PCV7 serotypes. Carriage rates in children remain unchanged, but the low CCRs of replacing serotypes would be expected to further reduce overall IPD across all age groups.},

abstract = {This study was performed to estimate the effect of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) on the pneumonia admission rate in children younger than 5 years of age, after the introduction of routine 2+1 dose schedule immunization. We compared the pneumonia admission rate (number of cases per 1,000 population) 2 years before and 2 years after the introduction of PCV7 in 2006. Only children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were analyzed. The vaccination rate in the analyzed periods was around 99{\%}. In the period preceding the implementation of PCV7, the average pneumonia admission rate was 41.48/1,000 and 6.15/1,000 for 1-year-old and 2-4-year-old children, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a significant fall in this rate in two consecutive years after PCV7 implementation (p {\textless} 0.0000001 for 1-year-old and p = 0.011 for 2-4-year-old children, respectively). In the first year of vaccination, the admission number decreased in these two groups by about 65 and 23{\%}, respectively. In the second year, only a few percent fall in the admission rate was noted. In children younger than 2 years of age, the age group targeted for vaccination, pneumonia-related healthcare utilization declined substantially following PCV7 introduction. These results suggest that PCV7 may play an important role in reducing the burden of pneumonia in Poland.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) resulted in decreases in invasive disease among children and elderly persons. The benefits may be offset by increases in disease due to serotypes not included in the vaccine (hereafter, "nonvaccine serotypes"). We evaluated the effect of PCV7 on incidence of disease due to nonvaccine serotypes. METHODS: Cases of invasive disease were identified in 8 geographic areas through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Active Bacterial Core surveillance. Serotyping and susceptibility testing of isolates were performed. We calculated the incidence of disease for children aged {\textless}5 years and adults aged {\textgreater} or =65 years. We compared rates of serotype-specific disease before and after PCV7 was licensed for use. RESULTS: The annual incidence of disease due to nonvaccine serotypes increased from an average of 16.3 cases/100,000 population during prevaccine years (1998-1999) to 19.9 cases/100,000 population in 2004 for children aged {\textless}5 years (P=.01) and from 27.0 cases/100,000 population during prevaccine years to 29.8 cases/100,000 population in 2004 for adults aged {\textgreater} or =65 years (P=.05). Significant increases in the incidences of disease due to serotypes 3, 15, 19A, 22F, and 33F were observed among children during this period (P{\textless}.05 for each serotype); serotype 19A has become the predominant cause of invasive disease in children. The incidence of disease due to these serotypes also increased among elderly persons. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pneumococcal disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes is increasing. Ongoing surveillance is needed to monitor the magnitude of disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes, to ensure that future vaccines target the appropriate serotypes.},

Transmission matrices can be used to estimate age-dependent forces of infection in age-structured, compartmental models for the study of infectious diseases. We analyze the social network generated by the synthetic population of Portland and extract mixing patterns. Our results show that the mixing within the population consists of two groups, children and adults. Children interact most frequently with other children close to their own age, while adults interact with a wider range of age groups and the durations of typical adult contacts are shorter than typical contacts between children.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis in children worldwide. However, many countries lack national estimates of disease burden. Effective interventions are available, including pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and case management. To support local and global policy decisions on pneumococcal disease prevention and treatment, we estimated country-specific incidence of serious cases and deaths in children younger than 5 years. METHODS We measured the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia by applying the proportion of pneumonia cases caused by S pneumoniae derived from efficacy estimates from vaccine trials to WHO country-specific estimates of all-cause pneumonia cases and deaths. We also estimated burden of meningitis and non-pneumonia, non-meningitis invasive disease using disease incidence and case-fatality data from a systematic literature review. When high-quality data were available from a country, these were used for national estimates. Otherwise, estimates were based on data from neighbouring countries with similar child mortality. Estimates were adjusted for HIV prevalence and access to care and, when applicable, use of vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b. FINDINGS In 2000, about 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease (uncertainty range 11.1-18.0 million) were estimated to occur. Pneumococcal disease caused about 826,000 deaths (582,000-926,000) in children aged 1-59 months, of which 91,000 (63,000-102,000) were in HIV-positive and 735,000 (519,000-825,000) in HIV-negative children. Of the deaths in HIV-negative children, over 61{\%} (449,000 [316,000-501,000]) occurred in ten African and Asian countries. INTERPRETATION S pneumoniae causes around 11{\%} (8-12{\%}) of all deaths in children aged 1-59 months (excluding pneumococcal deaths in HIV-positive children). Achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goal 4 for child mortality reduction can be accelerated by prevention and treatment of pneumococcal disease, especially in regions of the world with the greatest burden.

Methods: This study used a decision-analytic model to simulate the costs and consequences of the ototopical treatment of AOMT. The AOMT model consisted of 3 tierse of antimicrobial therapy. Each successive tier represented the repeat treatment of clinical failures from the preceding tier. Patients were modeled for treatment until cured or until third-tier therapy was complete, at which time patients were considered cured. First-tier therapy modeled a comparison of CD and OFX using efficacy rates taken from a randomized clinical trial with a population of 599 patients. Second-tier therapy modeled the use of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid using an efficacy rate taken from the medical literature. Third-tier therapy was modeled as being pathogen specific and could follow 1 of 3 possible clinical pathways: (1) PO fluconazole, (2) IM ceftriaxone, or (3) IV antibiotics administered in a hospital setting. Third-tier therapeutic pathway probabilities were based on the microbiologic spectrum of the treatment failures from the clinical trial. Cost information (in year-2003 US dollars) was taken from accepted cost reference sources and presented from the perspective of a third-party payer. The economic outcome of interest was the cost-effectiveness threshold of CD relative to OFX. Results: Given the model parameters, CD had a cost-effectiveness threshold value of 4.5 times the wholesale acquisition cost of OFX. Based on actual cost, first-tier CD therapy was more cost-effective than OFX up to a threshold price of {\$}152.64. Conclusion: In this decision-analytic model, CD was more cost-effective than OFX for AOMT therapy in pediatric patients up to a threshold price of 4.5 times the price of OFX.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The relationship between pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-induced antibody responses and protection against community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute otitis media (AOM) is unclear. This study assessed the impact of the ten-valent pneumococcal nontypable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) on these end points. The primary objective was to demonstrate vaccine efficacy (VE) in a per-protocol analysis against likely bacterial CAP (B-CAP: radiologically confirmed CAP with alveolar consolidation/pleural effusion on chest X-ray, or non-alveolar infiltrates and C-reactive protein ≥ 40 µg/ml); other protocol-specified outcomes were also assessed. METHODS AND FINDINGS This phase III double-blind randomized controlled study was conducted between 28 June 2007 and 28 July 2011 in Argentine, Panamanian, and Colombian populations with good access to health care. Approximately 24,000 infants received PHiD-CV or hepatitis control vaccine (hepatitis B for primary vaccination, hepatitis A at booster) at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 mo of age. Interim analysis of the primary end point was planned when 535 first B-CAP episodes, occurring ≥2 wk after dose 3, were identified in the per-protocol cohort. After a mean follow-up of 23 mo (PHiD-CV, n = 10,295; control, n = 10,201), per-protocol VE was 22.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 7.7, 34.2; one-sided p = 0.002) against B-CAP (conclusive for primary objective) and 25.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 8.4{\%}, 39.6{\%}) against World Health Organization-defined consolidated CAP. Intent-to-treat VE was 18.2{\%} (95{\%} CI: 5.5{\%}, 29.1{\%}) against B-CAP and 23.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 8.8{\%}, 35.7{\%}) against consolidated CAP. End-of-study per-protocol analyses were performed after a mean follow-up of 28-30 mo for CAP and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (PHiD-CV, n = 10,211; control, n = 10,140) and AOM (n = 3,010 and 2,979, respectively). Per-protocol VE was 16.1{\%} (95{\%} CI: -1.1{\%}, 30.4{\%}; one-sided p = 0.032) against clinically confirmed AOM, 67.1{\%} (95{\%} CI: 17.0{\%}, 86.9{\%}) against vaccine serotype clinically confirmed AOM, 100{\%} (95{\%} CI: 74.3{\%}, 100{\%}) against vaccine serotype IPD, and 65.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 11.1{\%}, 86.2{\%}) against any IPD. Results were consistent between intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Serious adverse events were reported for 21.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 20.7{\%}, 22.2{\%}) and 22.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 21.9{\%}, 23.4{\%}) of PHiD-CV and control recipients, respectively. There were 19 deaths (n = 11,798; 0.16{\%}) in the PHiD-CV group and 26 deaths (n = 11,799; 0.22{\%}) in the control group. A significant study limitation was the lower than expected number of captured AOM cases.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: When seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in the USA, many children were vaccinated on schedules that differed from those tested in clinical trials. Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine against various pneumococcal serotypes, and to measure the effectiveness of the recommended dose schedule and of catch-up and incomplete schedules. METHODS: Invasive disease, defined as isolation of pneumococcus from a sterile site, was identified in children aged 3-59 months through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Active Bacterial Core surveillance. We tested isolates for serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility. Three controls, matched for age and zip code were selected for each case. We calculated the matched odds ratio for vaccination using conditional logistic regression, controlling for underlying conditions. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus the adjusted matched odds ratio times 100{\%}. FINDINGS: We enrolled 782 cases and 2512 controls. Effectiveness of one or more doses against vaccine serotypes was 96{\%} (95{\%} CI 93-98) in healthy children and 81{\%} (57-92) in those with coexisting disorders. It was 76{\%} (63-85) against infections that were not susceptible to penicillin. Vaccination prevented disease caused by all seven vaccine serotypes, and by vaccine-related serotype 6A. Several schedules were more protective than no vaccination; three infant doses with a booster were more protective against vaccine-type disease than were three infant doses alone (p=0.0323). INTERPRETATION: The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine prevents invasive disease in both healthy and chronically ill children. The vaccine is effective when used with various non-standard schedules.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen worldwide. Accurate sampling of S. pneumoniae carriage is central to surveillance studies before and following conjugate vaccination programmes to combat pneumococcal disease. Any bias introduced during sampling will affect downstream recovery and typing. Many variables exist for the method of collection and initial processing, which can make inter-laboratory or international comparisons of data complex. In February 2003, a World Health Organisation working group published a standard method for the detection of pneumococcal carriage for vaccine trials to reduce or eliminate variability. We sought to describe the variables associated with the sampling of S. pneumoniae from collection to storage in the context of the methods recommended by the WHO and those used in pneumococcal carriage studies since its publication. A search of published literature in the online PubMed database was performed on the 1st June 2012, to identify published studies that collected pneumococcal carriage isolates, conducted after the publication of the WHO standard method. After undertaking a systematic analysis of the literature, we show that a number of differences in pneumococcal sampling protocol continue to exist between studies since the WHO publication. The majority of studies sample from the nasopharynx, but the choice of swab and swab transport media is more variable between studies. At present there is insufficient experimental data that supports the optimal sensitivity of any standard method. This may have contributed to incomplete adoption of the primary stages of the WHO detection protocol, alongside pragmatic or logistical issues associated with study design. Consequently studies may not provide a true estimate of pneumococcal carriage. Optimal sampling of carriage could lead to improvements in downstream analysis and the evaluation of pneumococcal vaccine impact and extrapolation to pneumococcal disease control therefore further in depth comparisons would be of value.},

abstract = {After administering the 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugated vaccine (PHiD-CV) to children aged 2-18 months, we observed a reduction in vaccine-type nasopharyngeal carriage, resulting in a reduction of overall pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, which may be important for indirect vaccine effects. We noted a trend toward reduction of acute otitis media.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBACKGROUND: This trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00839254), nested within a cluster-randomized double-blind invasive pneumococcal disease effectiveness study in Finland (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00861380), assessed the effectiveness of the 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugated vaccine (PHiD-CV or PCV10) against bacterial nasopharyngeal carriage and acute otitis media (AOM).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Infants (aged 6 weeks to 6 months) received the PHiD-CV or a control vaccine (hepatitis B) (schedule 3+1 or 2+1). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 4 time points post-vaccination from all of the infants and at pre-vaccination from a subset. Parent-reported physician-diagnosed AOM was assessed from first vaccination until last contact (mean follow-up, 18 months). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was derived as (1 - relative risk)*100, accounting for cluster design in AOM analysis. Significant VE was assessed descriptively (positive lower limit of the non-adjusted 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The vaccinated cohort included 5093 infants for carriage assessment and 4117 infants for AOM assessment. Both schedules decreased vaccine-serotype carriage, with a trend toward a lesser effect from the 2+1 schedule ( VE across timpoints 19{\%}-56{\%} [3+1] and 1{\%}-38{\%} [2+1]). Trends toward reduced pneumococcal carriage (predominantly vaccine serotypes 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F), decreased carriage of vaccine-related serotype 19A, and small increases at later time points (ages 14-15 months) in non-vaccine-serotype carriage were observed. No effects on nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis carriage were observed. There were non-significant trends toward a reduction in the number of infants reporting AOM episodes (VE 3+1: 6.1{\%} [95{\%} CI, -2.7{\%} to 14.1{\%}] and 2+1: 7.4{\%} [-2.8{\%} to 16.6{\%}]) and all AOM episodes (VE 3+1: 2.8{\%} [-9.5{\%} to 13.9{\%}] and 2+1: 10.2{\%} [-4.1{\%} to 22.9{\%}]). PHiD-CV was immunogenic and had an acceptable safety profile.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We observed reduced vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage, a limited increase in non-vaccine-type carriage, and a trend toward AOM reduction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) licensure was based on the immune response (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and opsonophagocytic assay) compared with PCV7. National surveillance program of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal (PNP) carriage in children with acute otitis media (AOM) was set up in 2001 when PCV7 was introduced in France and continues to the present. This program was used in 2010-2011 to assess the effect of the implementation of PCV13 on PNP carriage in young children with AOM.

METHODS: Between October 2010 and March 2011, 58 pediatricians obtained 943 nasopharyngeal swabs from children (6 to 24 months of age) with AOM. The swabs were sent for analysis to the French National Reference Centre for Pneumococci. Demographics, medical history, and physical examination findings were recorded.

RESULTS: Among 943 children enrolled (mean age, 13.4 months), 651 had received at least 1 dose of PCV13 and 285 received PCV7 only. Among PCV13-vaccinated children, overall PNP carriage and carriage of serotypes not in PCV7 were significantly lower as compared with children exclusively vaccinated with PCV7 (53.9{\%} vs. 64.6{\%}, P = 0.002 and 9.5{\%} vs. 20.7{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). For serotypes 19A, 7F, and 6C, the carriage rates were also significantly lower in PCV13-vaccinated patients than in patients only vaccinated by PCV7: 7.5{\%} versus 15.4{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001, 0.5{\%} versus 2.8{\%}, P = 0.002, and 3.7{\%} versus 8.4{\%}, P = 0.003, respectively.

CONCLUSION: In young children ({\textless}2 years) with AOM, this study suggests that PCV13 has an impact on overall PNP carriage, as well as on serotypes 19A, 7F, and 6C.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Guidelines to treat acute otitis media (AOM) were published in 2004. Initial declines in prescribing were shown, but it's unknown if they were sustained. We examine trends in antibiotic dispensing patterns to treat AOM among a large population of children. We also document trends in antibiotic failure. STUDY DESIGN Children aged 3 months to 12 years with an AOM diagnosis, enrolled in a commercial claims database between January 1, 2000-December 31, 2011 were included. Pharmacy claims within 7 days of diagnosis were searched for antibiotic prescriptions. Antibiotic failure was defined as a dispensing of a different antibiotic class within 2-18 days after the first prescription. We analyzed trends in antibiotic use and failure by class of antibiotic and year. RESULTS We identified over 4 million children under 13 years with AOM. The proportion of antibiotic dispensing decreased from 66.0{\%} in 2005 to 51.9{\%} in 2007, after which the instances of dispensing rebounded to pre-guideline levels. However, levels began decreasing again in 2010 and the antibiotic use rate in 2011 was 57.6{\%}. Cephalosporin prescriptions increased by 41.5{\%} over eleven years. Antibiotic failure decreased slightly, and macrolides had the lowest proportion of failures, while all other classes had failure rates around 10{\%}. CONCLUSIONS In recent years, antibiotic dispensing to treat AOM remains high. In addition, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is increasing despite having a high rate of treatment failure. Overprescribing of antibiotics and use of non-penicillin therapy for AOM treatment could lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant infections.},

abstract = {Background: Invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae remains an important worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in young children and the elderly. The development and use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have had a dramatic impact on rates of vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) not only in the pediatric population targeted for vaccination but in non-vaccinated age-groups as well. This indirect effect is directly mediated by a reduction of vaccine-type nasopharyngeal carriage and thus transmission by vaccinated children. Current PCV licensing procedures do not take into consideration nasopharyngeal carriage impact, and thus the indirect effect. This review summarizes the evidence for the indirect effect of PCV on vaccine-type disease and its correlation with changes in carriage among unvaccinated populations, to assess the basis for inclusion of carriage in the PCV licensing process. Methods: Randomized controlled trials, surveillance and other observational studies published between 1994 and 2013 were systematically identified from global, regional and review databases and conference abstracts. We included as primary evidence, studies in non-vaccinated groups addressing changes in both vaccine-type IPD and carriage between pre- and post-PCV introduction periods; studies missing one of these four components were included as supporting rather than primary evidence. Results: We identified studies from 14 countries, nearly all developed countries. Vaccine-type IPD and carriage in non-targeted populations consistently decreased after PCV introduction, with the magnitude of decrease growing over time. Where IPD and carriage were observed in the same population, VT-decreases occurred contemporaneously. These relationships held true across age-groups and between indigenous and non-indigenous populations in the US and Australia. Conclusions: Indirect PCV impact on VT-IPD and VT-carriage has been significant. Impact on carriage should be considered for inclusion in the PCV licensure process as a predictor of indirect effects. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is a revision of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians. It provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM. In 2009, the AAP convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the new literature related to AOM since the initial evidence report of 2000. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures. It also addresses recurrent AOM, which was not included in the 2004 guideline. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.},

abstract = {Background: Routine infant immunisation with seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) began in the USA in 2000. Although invasive pneumococcal disease has declined substantially, the programme's effect on hospital admissions for pneumonia is unknown. We therefore assessed the effect of the programme on rates of all-cause and pneumococcal pneumonia admissions. Methods: Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest inpatient database available in the USA, were analysed with an interrupted time-series analysis that used pneumonia (all-cause and pneumococcal) admission rates as the main outcomes. Monthly admission rates estimated for years after the introduction of PCV7 vaccination (2001-2004) were compared with expected rates calculated from pre-PCV7 years (1997-1999). The year of vaccine introduction (2000) was excluded, and rates of admission for dehydration were assessed for comparison. Findings: At the end of 2004, all-cause pneumonia admission rates had declined by 39{\%} (95{\%} CI 22-52) for children younger than 2 years, who were the target population of the vaccination programme. This annual decline in all-cause pneumonia admissions of 506 (291-675) per 100 000 children younger than 2 years represented about 41 000 pneumonia admissions prevented in 2004. During the 8 study years, 10 659 (2{\%}) children younger than 2 years admitted with pneumonia were coded as having pneumococcal disease; these rates declined by 65{\%} (47-77). This decline represented about 17 fewer admissions per 100 000 children in 2004. Admission rates for dehydration for children younger than 2 years remained stable over the study period. Interpretation: The reduction in all-cause pneumonia admissions in children younger than 2 years provides an estimate of the proportion of childhood pneumonias attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae in the USA that are vaccine preventable. Our results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the beneficial effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent guidance for the management of acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes is based on limited evidence from trials comparing oral antibiotic agents with topical antibiotics. METHODS In this open-label, pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned 230 children, 1 to 10 years of age, who had acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea to receive hydrocortisone-bacitracin-colistin eardrops (76 children) or oral amoxicillin-clavulanate suspension (77) or to undergo initial observation (77). The primary outcome was the presence of otorrhea, as assessed otoscopically, 2 weeks after study-group assignment. Secondary outcomes were the duration of the initial otorrhea episode, the total number of days of otorrhea and the number of otorrhea recurrences during 6 months of follow-up, quality of life, complications, and treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation for all outcomes. At 2 weeks, 5{\%} of children treated with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops had otorrhea, as compared with 44{\%} of those treated with oral antibiotics (risk difference, -39 percentage points; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -51 to -26) and 55{\%} of those treated with initial observation (risk difference, -49 percentage points; 95{\%} CI, -62 to -37). The median duration of the initial episode of otorrhea was 4 days for children treated with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops versus 5 days for those treated with oral antibiotics (P{\textless}0.001) and 12 days for those who were assigned to initial observation (P{\textless}0.001). Treatment-related adverse events were mild, and no complications of otitis media, including local cellulitis, perichondritis, mastoiditis, and intracranial complications, were reported at 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were more effective than oral antibiotics and initial observation in children with tympanostomy tubes who had uncomplicated acute otorrhea.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical reasons tympanostomy tubes are proposed for children and to assess their appropriateness. DESIGN Analysis of data previously collected prospectively by a national utilization review (UR) firm during a two-step UR process to assess the medical appropriateness of tympanostomy tube placement. Nurses interviewed otolaryngologists' and primary care physicians' office staff to collect clinical data. For a randomly selected subsample of cases found inappropriate, we reviewed subsequent interviews of the otolaryngologists by physician reviewers, who looked for possible extenuating clinical circumstances or additional clinical data that might have changed the appropriateness category. SETTING Otolaryngologists' practices from 49 states and the District of Columbia. PATIENTS All 6611 children younger than 16 years who were insured by three clients of the UR firm and whose proposal to receive tympanostomy tubes were reviewed by this system from January 1, 1990, through July 31, 1991. The insurance companies in the study insured 5.6 million Americans at the time of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The medical appropriateness of tympanostomy tube surgery according to explicit criteria developed by an expert panel using the RAND/University of California-Los Angeles modified Delphi method. RESULTS A total of 6429 (97{\%}) of the cases were proposed for recurrent acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, or both. Making generous clinical assumptions, 41{\%} of the proposals for these reasons had appropriate indications, 32{\%} had equivocal indications, and 27{\%} had inappropriate ones. Considering the additional information available from the subsample review, the proportion appropriate was 42{\%}, equivocal 35{\%}, and inappropriate 23{\%}. CONCLUSION About one quarter of tympanostomy tube insertions for children in this study were proposed for inappropriate indications and another third for equivocal ones.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the long term effects of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media in young children. DESIGN: Prospective three year follow-up study within the framework of a primary care based, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. SETTING: 53 general practices in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 168 children aged 6 months to 2 years with acute otitis media. INTERVENTIONS: Amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day in three doses compared with placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrence of acute otitis media; referral to secondary care; ear, nose, and throat surgery. RESULTS: Acute otitis media recurred in 63{\%} (47/75) of children in the amoxicillin group and in 43{\%} (37/86) of the placebo group (risk difference 20{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval 5{\%} to 35{\%}); 30{\%} (24/78 amoxicillin; 27/89 placebo) of children in both groups were referred to secondary care, and 21{\%} (16/78) of the amoxicillin group compared with 30{\%} (27/90) of the placebo group had ear, nose, and throat surgery (risk difference -9{\%}, -23{\%} to 4{\%}). CONCLUSION: Recurrent acute otitis media occurred more often in the children originally treated with amoxicillin. This is another argument for judicious use of antibiotics in children with acute otitis media. Trial registration Netherlands Trial Register NTR1426.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This ten-year cohort study was intended to determine the incidence and expected outcome of ventilation tube treatment at a clinic that serves a community with 300,000 inhabitants. METHODS All children aged 0-10 years, who received their first ventilation tube during 1996, were followed over 10 years, at the department of Otorhinolaryngology, county hospital Ryhov, J{\"{o}}nk{\"{o}}ping, Sweden. All acute and planned visits were recorded and analyzed, but no extra visits were scheduled due to participation in the study. RESULTS In 1996 the overall incidence of tube insertion in the age group 0-10 years was 1 percent. A total of 155 children were entered, and 146 (94 percent) fulfilled the study. During the 10 years' follow up, a total of 409 acute visits and 1485 planned visits were made. In approximately 50 percent of the cases the first ventilation tube was still in place after one year. Infection occurred in 53 percent of the treated ear(s) at least once; the risk for infection was higher if the indication for ventilation tube placement was recurrent acute otitis media. In 45 percent of the children at least one more tube insertion was needed. A permanent perforation after tube treatment was seen in 2 percent of the treated ears. After 5 years, one half of the children were declared free from middle ear disease, but at the termination of the study 17 percent of the children were still in need of regular visits to an otologist due to residual ear problems. CONCLUSION This study shows the natural course of treatment with middle ear ventilation tubes in a cohort of children aged 0-10 years during a ten-year period. The incidence of ventilation tube treatment was 1 percent. It is evident that many children need a prolonged contact with an ear-nose and throat specialist when treated with a ventilation tube.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an uncommon but well-recognized cause of invasive bacterial disease in young infants. This study aimed to determine the impact of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in infants aged {\textless}90 days in England and Wales and describe their clinical characteristics following PCV7 introduction. METHODS: Trends in IPD among infants aged {\textless}90 days during 1998-1999 through 2009-2010 were analyzed using enhanced national surveillance data. Following PCV7 introduction, clinical information was also obtained for IPD cases in the birth cohorts eligible for vaccination. RESULTS: Prior to PCV7 introduction, IPD incidence in infants aged {\textless}90 days was 13.0 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 12.0-14.0) per 100 000 live births and PCV7 serotypes accounted for 44{\%} (154/349) of serotyped isolates. PCV7 introduction resulted in 83{\%} (95{\%} CI, 66{\%}-91{\%}, P {\textless} .001) reduction in PCV7 IPD and a declining trend in overall IPD by 2009-2010. Of the 256 cases diagnosed after PCV7 introduction, 23{\%} (n = 60) had been born before 37 weeks' gestation. A third of cases (84/256, 33{\%}) developed IPD in the first 48 hours of life, where 42{\%} (35/84) were premature. Meningitis was diagnosed in 94 infants (37{\%}) and its prevalence increased with age. Case fatality was 7{\%} (18/256) and was higher for meningitis than nonmeningitis cases (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [95{\%} CI, 1.2-12.0], P = .024). CONCLUSIONS: Young infants have benefited from PCV7 through indirect (herd) protection. Given that a third of cases occurred within 48 hours of birth, further studies should focus on risk factors for IPD in pregnancy and strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The heptavalent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV7) confers protection against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by serotypes that are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In 2000, the 7 serotypes covered by PCV7 accounted for 80{\%} to 90{\%} of serotypes isolated from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of children aged {\textless}6 years in the United States. A previous review of the literature spanning the years 1998 to 2005 pertaining to the incidence of IPD among nonimmunized individuals in countries with universal PCV7 immunization suggested an indirect protective effect (herd protection, or community immunity) after widespread vaccination. Consideration of indirect protection against IPD may enhance cost-benefit evaluations of vaccination programs.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to review the literature on cost-effectiveness analyses of PCV7 vaccination to determine whether inclusion of the indirect effect in decision-analysis models substantially affects the cost-effectiveness findings in favor of vaccination.

METHODS: A literature review of cost-effectiveness analyses of PCV7 vaccination was conducted using the DIMDI (Deutschen Institut fur Medizinische Dokumentation und Information) superbase, which comprises 12 databases, to identify articles published between January 2000 and October 2006 using the search terms 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine AND herd immunity/herd effect, and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine AND cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-benefit analyses. Monetary values were converted to euros and inflated to 2006 values, and events avoided were converted to rates per 100,000 vaccinated to allow comparison across studies. The sensitivity analyses from the models that included indirect effects were examined.

RESULTS: There was wide variability in the health-economic results of the 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria. In studies that did not include indirect effects, the adjusted cost per life-year gained ranged from cost saving to euro140,723 from the societal perspective and from euro56,724 to euro324,218 from the payer perspective. In the 4 studies that included indirect effects, a significant and consistent improvement was seen in the health-economic results in favor of vaccination with PCV7. No trends in variability across time or geographic region were observed.

CONCLUSIONS: Indirect effects had a significant effect on cost-effectiveness, as seen in the sensitivity analyses. Future models should include indirect effects in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of PCV7.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Interrupted time series is a strong quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the impacts of health policy interventions. Using simulation methods, we estimated the power requirements for interrupted time series studies under various scenarios. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING Simulations were conducted to estimate the power of segmented autoregressive (AR) error models when autocorrelation ranged from −0.9 to 0.9 and effect size was 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, investigating balanced and unbalanced numbers of time periods before and after an intervention. Simple scenarios of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models were also explored. RESULTS For AR models, power increased when sample size or effect size increased, and tended to decrease when autocorrelation increased. Compared with a balanced number of study periods before and after an intervention, designs with unbalanced numbers of periods had less power, although that was not the case for ARCH models. CONCLUSION The power to detect effect size 1.0 appeared to be reasonable for many practical applications with a moderate or large number of time points in the study equally divided around the intervention. Investigators should be cautious when the expected effect size is small or the number of time points is small. We recommend conducting various simulations before investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media causes human suffering and enormous costs to society. Symptoms of acute otitis media overlap those of the common cold, and diagnostic methods confirming the diagnosis are used only occasionally. Uncertainty in diagnostics may lead either to overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment or to underdiagnosis and an increase in complications. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate the inter-rater agreement in diagnosis of acute otitis media for children in primary health care. METHODS The GP on duty and the otorhinolaryngology resident at a primary health care clinic examined the same 50 children with caregiver-suspected acute otitis media. The otorhinolaryngologist photographed the tympanic membranes. Afterwards, two experienced clinicians evaluated the photographs with and without tympanograms. Diagnostic rates and diagnostic methods between clinicians were compared. RESULTS The otorhinolaryngologist diagnosed acute otitis media in 44{\%} and the GP in 64{\%}. The GP based the diagnoses on symptoms and on the colour of the tympanic membrane, whereas the otorhinolaryngologist paid more attention to the movement and position of the tympanic membrane. CONCLUSION The use of a pneumatic otoscope and tympanometry reduces the number of acute otitis media diagnoses by {\textgreater}30{\%}, suggesting that acute otitis media may be misdiagnosed often. Between clinicians, there was a substantial discrepancy in diagnoses of acute otitis media.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare immediate with delayed prescribing of antibiotics for acute otitis media. DESIGN Open randomised controlled trial. SETTING General practices in south west England. PARTICIPANTS 315 children aged between 6 months and 10 years presenting with acute otitis media. INTERVENTIONS Two treatment strategies, supported by standardised advice sheets-immediate antibiotics or delayed antibiotics (antibiotic prescription to be collected at parents' discretion after 72 hours if child still not improving). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Symptom resolution, absence from school or nursery, paracetamol consumption. RESULTS On average, symptoms resolved after 3 days. Children prescribed antibiotics immediately had shorter illness (-1.1 days (95{\%} confidence interval -0.54 to -1.48)), fewer nights disturbed (-0.72 (-0.30 to -1.13)), and slightly less paracetamol consumption (-0.52 spoons/day (-0.26 to -0.79)). There was no difference in school absence or pain or distress scores since benefits of antibiotics occurred mainly after the first 24 hours-when distress was less severe. Parents of 36/150 of the children given delayed prescriptions used antibiotics, and 77{\%} were very satisfied. Fewer children in the delayed group had diarrhoea (14/150 (9{\%}) v 25/135 (19{\%}), chi(2)=5.2, P=0.02). Fewer parents in the delayed group believed in the effectiveness of antibiotics and in the need to see the doctor with future episodes. CONCLUSION Immediate antibiotic prescription provided symptomatic benefit mainly after first 24 hours, when symptoms were already resolving. For children who are not very unwell systemically, a wait and see approach seems feasible and acceptable to parents and should substantially reduce the use of antibiotics for acute otitis media.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Determine the prevalence and safety of pediatric ambulatory otolaryngologic procedures in the United States. STUDY DESIGN Historical cohort study. METHODS All cases of pediatric otolaryngologic surgery were extracted from the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery 2006 release. The population was characterized according to age, sex, and individual procedures performed. Rates of immediate perioperative complications were determined for arrest, malignant hyperthermia, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and postoperative nausea/vomiting. Discharge status and unexpected medical return visits were tabulated. Complication rates for patients younger than 3 years were compared to the remaining cohort. RESULTS An estimated 1,410,546 +/- 246,009 (+/- standard error) children underwent one or more pediatric otolaryngologic procedures in 2006 (mean age, 6.23 +/- 0.19 years; 50.9{\%} +/- 2.2{\%} male). The most common primary procedures performed were myringotomy and tube (551,222 cases), tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy (480,343 cases), adenoidectomy (81,048 cases), tonsillectomy (56,606 cases), myringotomy alone (27,691 cases), tympanostomy tube removal (21,446 cases), and close reduction of nasal fracture (15,230 cases). There were no reported cases of cardiac arrest, malignant hyperthermia, or blood transfusion. Postoperative nausea, vomiting, and perioperative bleeding occurred in 1.4{\%}, 0.9{\%}, and 0.2{\%} of cases, respectively. Children younger than 4 years undergoing tonsillectomy were more likely to return to the surgery center (2.5{\%}, P {\textless} .001) or have an unplanned admission (9.28{\%}, P = .011) than older children. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric otolaryngologic surgery is not only common but very safe in the ambulatory setting, with relatively minor complications occurring at rates of approximating 1{\%}. Life-threatening complications are exceedingly rare. Ambulatory tonsillectomy in children younger than 4 years requires careful selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed as a treatment of choice. The conventional recommendation is either three or four daily doses. However, nowadays it is frequently prescribed as once or twice daily doses. If once or twice daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is as effective for acute otitis media as three or four times a day, it may be more convenient to give the medication once or twice a day to children and hence improve compliance. OBJECTIVES To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children; and to compare complication rates and adverse reactions. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1950 to March week 1, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013) and the Science Citation Index (2001 to March 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials and assessed trial quality based on selection bias, performance bias and detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We defined the quality grading as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. We summarised the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS We included five studies with 1601 children in the review. Pooled analysis demonstrated that the following outcomes were comparable between the two groups: clinical cure at the end of therapy (RR 1.03, 95{\%} CI 0.99 to 1.07); during therapy (RR 1.06, 95{\%} CI 0.85 to 1.33) and at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95{\%} CI 0.95 to 1.09); recurrent AOM (RR 1.21, 95{\%} CI 0.52 to 2.81); compliance rate (RR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 0.98 to 1.10) and overall adverse events (RR 0.92, 95{\%} CI 0.52 to 1.63). When we performed subgroup analysis separately for trials with amoxicillin only and amoxicillin/clavulanate only, it showed that all important outcomes were comparable between once or twice daily groups and the three times daily group. The risk of bias amongst the five included studies was as follows: for random sequence generation we graded two studies as low and three unclear risk of bias; for allocation concealment all studies were at unclear risk of bias; for blinding (performance and detection bias) we graded four as high and one as unclear risk of bias; for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) we graded two low, two high and one as unclear risk of bias; for reporting bias four were at low and one at high risk; and for 'other' bias four were at low and one at unclear risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review showed that the results of using once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three doses for the treatment of AOM.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to provide a nationally representative analysis of antibiotic prescribing in outpatient paediatrics and to assess overall and class-specific antibiotic costs in Greece. METHODS Data on antibiotic prescriptions for patients aged ≤19 years old between July 2010 and June 2013 in Greece were extracted from the IMS Health Xponent database. Antibiotics were grouped into narrow- and broad-spectrum agents. The number of prescribed antibiotics and census denominators were used to calculate prescribing rates. The total costs associated with prescribed antibiotics were calculated. RESULTS More than 7 million antibiotics were prescribed during the study period, with an annual rate of 1100 antibiotics/1000 persons. Prescribing rates were higher among children aged {\textless}10 years old. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) accounted for 80{\%} of prescribed antibiotics, with acute otitis media (22.3{\%}), acute tonsillitis (19.5{\%}) and acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis (13.9{\%}) being the most common clinical diagnoses. Cephalosporins (32.9{\%}), penicillins (32.3{\%}) and macrolides (32.1{\%}) were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic classes. The majority (90.4{\%}) of antibiotics were broad spectrum. Antibiotic expenditures totalled ∼€50 million. CONCLUSIONS Broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing is common in outpatient paediatric patients. These data provide important targets to inform the development of an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programme targeting specific practices, providers and conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1995, a publicly funded pneumococcal vaccination program for 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was introduced in Ontario. Conjugate vaccines were authorized in 2001 (PCV7), 2009 (PCV10) and 2010 (PCV13). METHODS: From 1995-2011, active, population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was conducted in Metropolitan Toronto and Peel Region, Canada. RESULTS: 6404 IPD cases were included. After PPV23 program implementation in 1995, IPD due to PPV23 strains decreased 49{\%} in older adults prior to PCV7 introduction. Estimated PPV23 efficacy in vaccine eligible adults was 42.2{\%} (95{\%} CI; 28.6-53.2{\%}). IPD incidence due to PCV7 serotypes in children {\textless}5 years decreased significantly after PCV7 authorization and before introduction of a publicly funded PCV7 program. Seven years after PCV7 program implementation, the incidence of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes decreased to zero in children and by 88{\%} in adults, however, overall IPD incidence remained unchanged in adults. In 2011, the incidence of IPD was 4.5 per 100,000 in adults aged 15-64 and 19.9 per 100,000 in adults aged over 65 years, with 45 serotypes causing disease. Between 1995 and 2011, the case fatality rate of IPD in adults decreased 2{\%} per year (95{\%} CI, -0.9{\%} to -3.2{\%}). In multivariable analysis, predictors of mortality included older age, chronic conditions, nursing home residence, current smoking, bacteraemia, and illness due to serotypes 3,11A, 19A, and 19F. CONCLUSIONS: While vaccination programs resulted in substantial public health benefits, herd immunity benefits of PCV7 were seen at low pediatric vaccination rates, and the case fatality rate of IPD has decreased, IPD will continue to be a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality in adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Improved Childhood Immunizations Programs, especially the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination, better diagnostic methods and the importance of reduced antibiotic misuse, make this a critical time to increase knowledge on the etiology of pediatric pneumonia. Our main objective was to identify the contribution of various microbiological species that causes pneumonia in previously healthy children and adolescents in a population with high pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage. METHODS This prospective, observational study enrolled patients with clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia over a 2-year period. Both inpatients and outpatients were included. Paired sera, nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction and bacterial cultures from blood and pleura were analyzed to detect potential viral and bacterial causative pathogens. RESULTS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FIVE: cases of clinical and radiological verified pneumonia were identified. The pneumococcal vaccine coverage was 85{\%}. We identified a causative pathogen in 84.2{\%} of all cases; 63.4{\%} with single viral etiology, 11.3{\%} with pneumococcus and 7.5{\%} with mycoplasma infection. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen in children younger than 5 years, whereas mycoplasma was the most common in older children. CONCLUSIONS We identified the majority of 265 cases with radiology proven pneumonia as single viral infections, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus and a much lower proportion of bacterial causes. These findings may impact pneumonia management guidelines in areas where widespread pneumococcal vaccination is provided and contribute to reduced antibiotic overuse in pediatric pneumonia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Pneumococcal diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in young infants and the elderly. The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has been available on the private market in Taiwan since October 2005. To date, there has not been any cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of PCV7 in Taiwan. A pharmacoeconomic model populated with local parameters is needed for vaccine decision-making. The aim of the study was to provide a CEA of PCV7 in Taiwan and explore the impact of herd effect and indirect cost on the findings of CEA.

METHODS: A decision analytic model was populated with local epidemiological and economic data to simulate the expected clinical and economic outcomes from a hypothetical vaccinated birth cohort of 191,310 infants compared to no vaccination over a 10-year time horizon. To explore the impact of herd effect, results were presented with and without herd effect. Moreover, the study was conducted from both payer and societal perspectives to examine the impact of indirect cost. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model robustness. The cost-effectiveness of a reduced three-dose schedule was also estimated.

RESULTS: PCV7 vaccination could prevent 1281 cases of invasive pneumococcal diseases, 178,145 cases of all-cause hospitalized pneumonia, 69,962 cases of all-cause acute otitis media, and 981 deaths over a 10-year time horizon. The vaccination program with an annual cost of NT{\$}1,950.5 million could lead to 15.4{\%} reduction in direct medical costs of NT{\$}6,010 million and 64.1{\%} reduction in indirect costs of NT{\$}9,467 million. The vaccination with a four-dose schedule would lead to an incremental cost of NT{\$}1,183,028 per life-year gained from the payer perspective and NT{\$}619,862 per life-year gained from the societal perspective.

CONCLUSION: Taking herd effect and indirect costs into account, PCV7 vaccination is cost-effective in Taiwan. Further pharmacoeconomic model should include herd effect in CEA of infectious disease research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Routine infant vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) began in the Calgary Health Region (Alberta, Canada) in 2002. We measured the impact of this vaccine program on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). METHODS: Prospective, population-based surveillance of all cases of IPD (with culture specimens obtained from sterile sites) was conducted from January 1998 through December 2007. Demographic and clinical data were collected. All viable isolates were saved and serotyped. RESULTS: There were 1182 IPD cases over the 10-year period. Comparison of the vaccine period (2003-2007) with the prevaccine period (1998-2001) revealed that the incidence of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes decreased significantly by 86{\%}, 59{\%}, 38{\%}, and 78{\%} in the 6-23-month, 2-4-year, 16-64-year, and 65-84-year age groups, respectively. The total number of IPD cases decreased by 77{\%}, 45{\%}, and 34{\%} in the 6-23-month, 2-4-year, and 65-84-year age groups, respectively. The incidence of IPD due to non-PCV7 serotypes increased by 183{\%}, and the total incidence of IPD increased by 73{\%} among adults aged 16-64 years; however, this increase was primarily attributed to a large outbreak of serotype 5 IPD among homeless adults during the period 2005-2007. There were 5 cases of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes among vaccinated children in the vaccine period. CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of PCV7 vaccine, there has been a profound decrease in the total number of cases of IPD among children and in cases due to PCV7 serotypes among subjects of all ages in Calgary, indicating a strong direct effect and herd effect of the vaccine. The serotypes that now cause IPD have changed significantly. The magnitude and impact of replacement IPD caused by non-PCV7 serotypes is not yet known.},

abstract = {Invasive pneumococcal infection remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality in young children. In developed nations, a substantial decrease in the incidence of IPD has been achieved with inclusion of the 7 valent protein conjugated pneumococcal vaccines (7vPCV) into paediatric vaccine schedules. In contrast, the incidence of IPD has changed little in developing nations. This is likely due to poor access to medical care and pneumococcal vaccination, the accompanying HIV and malnutrition burden, and the fact that 7vPCV does not contain the most common serotypes (1,5, 6A) responsible for IPD in many developing nations. The battle against IPD in developed nations is not over, with the rise of non-7vPCV serotypes since routine 7vPCV vaccination. This has necessitated the development and distribution of pneumococcal vaccines containing 3 or 6 additional serotypes. This article provides an overview on pneumococcal carriage and risk factors for IPD, the rise of non-7vCPV serotypes in the era of 7vPCV vaccination, and the current and newly available broader valent pneumococcal vaccines. ?? 2011.},

Embedded in a demographic model, the transmission model of Hib carriage employs the most important social mixing patterns with three types of contact sites (family, day-care group, and school class). The model includes immunity against invasive Hib disease, initiated and boosted by Hib carriage and cross-reactive bacterial encounters. The model reproduces the observed age patterns in Hib carriage and disease in Finland before large-scale use of the Hib conjugate vaccines. The model was used to investigate characteristics of Hib transmission. The analysis emphasizes transmission between children and adults in families while pointing out the importance of pre-school and school-aged children in maintaining Hib circulation. Carriage in these age groups is thus identified as being essential to target for sustained effects of interventions by vaccination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiologic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains challenging in children because blood cultures have low sensitivity. Novel approaches are needed to confirm the role of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

METHODS: In this study, pneumococcal etiology was determined by serology using a subset of blood samples collected during a prospective multicentre observational study of children {\textless}15 years of age hospitalized in Belgium with radiogram-confirmed CAP. Blood samples were collected at admission and 3-4 weeks later. Pneumococcal (P)-CAP was defined in the presence of a positive blood or pleural fluid culture. Serotyping of S. pneumoniae isolates was done with the Quellung reaction. Serological diagnosis was assessed for 9 serotypes using World Health Organization-validated IgG and IgA serotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).

RESULTS: Paired admission/convalescent sera from 163 children were evaluated by ELISA (35 with proven P-CAP and 128 with nonproven P-CAP). ELISA detected pneumococci in 82.8{\%} of patients with proven P-CAP. The serotypes identified were the same as with the Quellung reaction in 82{\%} and 59{\%} of cases by IgG ELISA and IgA ELISA, respectively. Overall, ELISA identified a pneumococcal etiology in 55{\%} of patients with nonproven P-CAP. Serotypes 1 (51.6{\%}), 7F (19{\%}) and 5 (15.7{\%}) were the most frequent according to IgG ELISA.

CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the serological assay allows recognition of pneumococcal origin in 55{\%} of CAP patients with negative culture. This assay should improve the diagnosis of P-CAP in children and could be a useful tool for future epidemiological studies on childhood CAP etiology.},

abstract = {When a new vaccine is introduced, it is critical to monitor trends in disease rates to ensure that the vaccine is effective and to quantify its impact. However, estimates from observational studies can be confounded by unrelated changes in healthcare utilization, changes in the underlying health of the population, or changes in reporting. Other diseases are often used to detect and adjust for these changes, but choosing an appropriate control disease a priori is a major challenge. The "synthetic controls" (causal impact) method, which was originally developed for website analytics and social sciences, provides an appealing solution. With this approach, potential comparison time series are combined into a composite and are used to generate a counterfactual estimate, which can be compared with the time series of interest after the intervention. We sought to estimate changes in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia associated with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in five countries in the Americas. Using synthetic controls, we found a substantial decline in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia in infants in all five countries (average of 20{\%}), whereas estimates for young and middle-aged adults varied by country and were potentially influenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic. In contrast to previous reports, we did not detect a decline in all-cause pneumonia in older adults in any country. Synthetic controls promise to increase the accuracy of studies of vaccine impact and to increase comparability of results between populations compared with alternative approaches.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The introduction of routine childhood vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) has led to a decrease in the overall incidence of pneumococcal disease in all ages and a change in the serotype distribution of the remaining disease. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating ≥65 years and at risk adults with either the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or the 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in the UK, accounting for epidemiological changes.

METHODS: A population-based Markov model was used to track one UK-based cohort of individuals assuming PPV23, PCV13 or no vaccination until death.

RESULTS: The ICER was estimated at {\pounds}8413 when PPV23 was compared to no vaccination. PPV23 dominated PCV13.

CONCLUSION: This model suggests that vaccinating with PPV23 is cost-effective when compared to both PCV13 and no vaccination. As PPV23 covers 80-90{\%} in the UK of all serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal diseases, it remains cost-effective despite recent reductions in invasive pneumococcal diseases incidence in adults.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae represent a major public health problem. The purpose of this study was to compare, in the Japanese context, the projected health benefits, costs and cost-effectiveness of the latest generation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines which may provide important insight into the potential public health impact of interventions in the context of local disease-specific epidemiology. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare two vaccination strategies which involve routine infant immunization with either the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13; Prevenar 13™, Pfizer, Pearl River, NY, USA) or the 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV; Synflorix™, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA, Rixensart, Belgium) over a time horizon of 5 years from the healthcare provider and societal perspectives. Estimates for key model parameters were obtained from locally available databases and published literature. Incremental benefits in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life-year and cost-effectiveness were assessed. RESULTS: A 3 + 1 vaccination schedule for infants with PHiD-CV is expected to have a similar impact on invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia and a larger impact on acute otitis media-related outcomes compared with PCV-13. Assuming price parity for these vaccines, the model projected that vaccination with PHiD-CV would result in cost savings of 1.9 and 3.9 billion Japanese yen from the provider and societal perspectives, respectively. This was largely due to a reduction in highly prevalent acute otitis media. Vaccination with PHiD-CV was expected to generate a gain of 433 quality-adjusted life-years compared to PCV-13 translating into dominance over PCV-13. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of model outcome to changes in key model parameters and substantiated that the model outcome was consistently driven by the incremental benefit of PHiD-CV in averting acute otitis media. CONCLUSION: In comparison to PCV-13, vaccination with PHiD-CV is projected to be cost saving for Japan from both the healthcare provider and societal perspectives.},

abstract = {In February 2012, the novel respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) group A, genotype ON1, was detected in Kilifi County, coastal Kenya. ON1 is characterized by a 72-nt duplication within the highly variable G gene (encoding the immunogenic attachment surface protein). Cases were diagnosed through surveillance of pneumonia in children at the county hospital. Analysis of epidemiologic, clinical, and sequence data of RSV-A viruses detected over 5 RSV seasons (2010/2011 to 2014/2015) indicated the following: 1) replacement of previously circulating genotype GA2 ON1, 2) an abrupt expansion in the number of ON1 variants detected in the 2014/2015 epidemic, 3) recently accumulation of amino acid substitutions within the ON1 duplicated sequence, and 4) no clear evidence of altered pathogenicity relative to GA2. The study demonstrates the public health importance of molecular surveillance in defining the spread, clinical effects, and evolution of novel respiratory virus variants.},

abstract = {Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis is arguably the strongest quasi-experimental research design. ITS is particularly useful when a randomized trial is infeasible or unethical. The approach usually involves constructing a time series of population-level rates for a particular quality improvement focus (eg, rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] medication initiation) and testing statistically for a change in the outcome rate in the time periods before and time periods after implementation of a policy/program designed to change the outcome. In parallel, investigators often analyze rates of negative outcomes that might be (unintentionally) affected by the policy/program. We discuss why ITS is a useful tool for quality improvement. Strengths of ITS include the ability to control for secular trends in the data (unlike a 2-period before-and-after t test), ability to evaluate outcomes using population-level data, clear graphical presentation of results, ease of conducting stratified analyses, and ability to evaluate both intended and unintended consequences of interventions. Limitations of ITS include the need for a minimum of 8 time periods before and 8 after an intervention to evaluate changes statistically, difficulty in analyzing the independent impact of separate components of a program that are implemented close together in time, and existence of a suitable control population. Investigators must also be careful not to make individual-level inferences when population-level rates are used to evaluate interventions (though ITS can be used with individual-level data). A brief description of ITS is provided, including a fully implemented (but hypothetical) study of the impact of a program to reduce ADHD medication initiation in children younger than 5 years old and insured by Medicaid in Washington State. An example of the database needed to conduct an ITS is provided, as well as SAS code to implement a difference-in-differences model using preschool-age children in California as a comparison group.},

abstract = {Objectives: To describe the incidence and indications of adenoid surgery and concomitantly performed ENT surgical procedures in a nationwide cohort covering several years of practice. Methods: A retrospective study based on data from the National patient registry in Sweden. All children born from 1st of January 2004 to December 31st, 2013 who underwent adenoidectomy for the first time in Sweden during 2004-2013 were included in the study. Patient characteristics (age and gender), indications for surgery and performed ENT surgery were evaluated. Results: 40,829 children underwent adenoid surgery during the studied period. Of these, 24,537 (60{\%}) were boys. Mean and median age at surgery in the studied population was 4 years and 3.5 years respectively for both boys and girls. The most frequently performed surgical procedure was adenotonsillar surgery 43{\%} (n = 17,434) followed by solitary adenoid surgery 26{\%} (n = 10,749). The most frequent registered indication was hypertrophy 60{\%} (n = 24,422) followed by hypertrophy and otitis media 21{\%} (n = 8425). The highest age related incidence for all types of adenoid surgery taken together was 2-4 years of age for both genders. Boys had higher incidence rates than girls for all ages and all types of surgery except at eight years of age. Conclusions: The main findings were that adenoidectomy most commonly was performed together with surgery of the tonsils on the indication hypertrophy, that adenoid- and adenoid related ENT surgery were most commonly performed between 2 and 5 years of age and that the incidence in surgical rates was higher for boys than girls. There seem to be large unwarranted variations between countries regarding incidence rates and we believe that there is a need for further studies in order to establish recommendations for best practice regarding adenoid and related ENT surgeries.},

abstract = {• Antibiotic resistance is a serious threat to public health in Europe, leading to increased healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, treatment failures and sometimes death. • Over the last four years (2010 to 2013), the percentages of K. pneumoniae resistant to fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, as well as combined resistance to all three antibiotic groups has increased significantly at EU/EEA level. • During the same period, resistance to third-generation cephalosporins increased significantly at EU/EEA level for E. coli. • Carbapenems are an important group of last-line antibiotics for treatment of infections involving multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Although carbapenem resistance remains at relatively low levels for most countries, the significant increase of the population-weighted EU/EEA mean percentage of carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae is a cause for serious concern and a threat to patient safety in Europe. • In countries with high levels of multi-drug resistance, including resistance to carbapenems, only a few therapeutic options are available, among these are polymyxins. In these countries, presence of resistance to polymyxins is an important warning that options for the treatment of infected patients are becoming even more limited. • For the second year running, antibiotic resistance data for Acinetobacter species are available through EARS-Net. Data for 2013 show large inter-country variations in Europe. High percentages ({\textgreater}25{\%}) of isolates with combined resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and carbapenems were reported from southern and south-eastern Europe. • The percentage of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed a significant decreasing trend at EU/EEA level for the period 2010 to 2013, but the decrease was less pronounced compared to the previous four-year period. Although the continuous decreasing trend at EU/EEA level gives reason for optimism, MRSA remains a public health problem in Europe. In 2013, the EU/EEA population-weighted mean MRSA percentage remained high, and seven out of 30 reporting countries had MRSA percentages above 25{\%}. • Prudent antibiotic use and comprehensive infection control strategies targeting all healthcare sectors (acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities and ambulatory care) are the cornerstones of effective interventions to prevent selection and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.},

In a population-based cross-sectional study in Oslo. Norway, of 3,763 preschool children 3 to 4 years of age, the otolaryngological surgeries adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, myringotomy, ventilation tube insertion, and combinations of these were the outcome measures. The results showed that by 4 years of age, 13{\{}{\%}{\}} (n = 501) had undergone operation, and approximately two thirds of the operations involved middle ear surgery. Although surgery was related to the occurrence of upper respiratory tract infections, the type of surgery was not related to the specific infection. In the children with operations, the occurrence of recurrent otitis media ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}} or = 3 infections in the previous 12 months) was almost fivefold higher than in children without operations (adjusted adds ratio [ORadj] = 5.19 [3.15 to 8.54]). A low level of maternal education (ORadj = 1.61 [1.05 to 2.7] compared to the group with a high level of education) and atopy on the part of the child (ORadj = 1.58 [1.20 to 2.07]) increased the probability for upper airway surgery independently of the experience of infections. In conclusion, early pediatric otolaryngological surgery is common. The decisions for surgical treatment vary substantially and are not closely related to the specific infections. The influence of other factors such as maternal education indicates that decisions for surgery are not entirely based on medical evidence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In early 2000, a protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine targeting seven pneumococcal serotypes was licensed in the United States for use in young children. METHODS: We examined population-based data from the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to evaluate changes in the burden of invasive disease, defined by isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site. Serotyping and susceptibility testing of isolates were performed. We assessed trends using data from seven geographic areas with continuous participation from 1998 through 2001 (population, 16 million). RESULTS: The rate of invasive disease dropped from an average of 24.3 cases per 100,000 persons in 1998 and 1999 to 17.3 per 100,000 in 2001. The largest decline was in children under two years of age. In this group, the rate of disease was 69 percent lower in 2001 than the base-line rate (59.0 cases per 100,000 vs. 188.0 per 100,000, P{\textless}0.001); the rate of disease caused by vaccine and vaccine-related serotypes declined by 78 percent (P{\textless}0.001) and 50 percent (P{\textless}0.001), respectively. Disease rates also fell for adults; as compared with base line, the rate of disease in 2001 was 32 percent lower for adults 20 to 39 years of age (7.6 cases per 100,000 vs. 11.2 per 100,000, P{\textless}0.001), 8 percent lower for those 40 to 64 years of age (19.7 per 100,000 vs. 21.5 per 100,000, P=0.03), and 18 percent lower for those 65 years of age or more (49.5 per 100,000 vs. 60.1 per 100,000, P{\textless}0.001). The rate of disease caused by strains that were not susceptible to penicillin was 35 percent lower in 2001 than in 1999 (4.1 cases per 100,000 vs. 6.3 per 100,000, P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is preventing disease in young children, for whom the vaccine is indicated, and may be reducing the rate of disease in adults. The vaccine provides an effective new tool for reducing disease caused by drug-resistant strains.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND An increase in severe complications to otitis media is a potential threat to antibiotic restrictions and is difficult to measure due to its low-prevalent nature. Easily accessible indicators sensitive to illness change are needed to benchmark the judicious use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether there has been a constant increase of hospital admissions for acute otitis media after the year 2000. METHODS Registry-based study with complete data on hospitalization for acute otitis media and acute mastoiditis in Norway during 1999 to 2006. RESULTS Mean incidence rate for acute otitis media hospitalization was 22.4 per 10,000 children and peak incidence in the second year of life 52.2 per 10,000 children. Corresponding mean incidence rate and peak incidence for acute mastoiditis were 1.5 and 3.5 per 10,000 children in the second year of life, respectively. There was a gradient increase of the incidence rates of acute otitis media hospitalization from the year 2000 to 2006 considering the Poisson regression model with a significant test of linear trend. CONCLUSIONS Hospital admission for acute otitis media is prevalent enough to be a useful marker for otitis media severity and its distribution proportionate to that of acute mastoiditis.},

Meta-ethnographic methods were used, with data drawn from the primary studies in an interpretive analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The literature was dominated by concerns about antibiotic over-prescription. Children's views were not reported. Clinicians prescribed antibiotics when they felt pressured by parents or others (e.g. employers) to do so, when they believed there was a clear clinical indication, but also when they felt uncertain of clinical or social outcomes they prescribed "just in case". Parents wanted antibiotics when they felt they would improve the current illness, and when they felt pressure from daycare providers or employers. Clinicians avoided antibiotics when they were concerned about adverse reactions or drug resistance, when certain they were not indicated, and when there was no perceived pressure from parents. Parents also wished to avoid adverse effects of antibiotics, and did not want antibiotics when they would not relieve current symptoms. Some parents preferred to avoid medication altogether. Within paediatric consultations, parents sought a medical evaluation and decision. Primary care clinicians want satisfied parents and short consultations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prescriptions for childhood infections in primary care often result from "just in case" prescribing. These findings suggest that interventions which reduce clinician uncertainty regarding social or clinical outcomes and provide strategies to meet parents' needs within a short consultation are most likely to reduce antibiotic prescribing.},

Antibiotic susceptibility and serotypes of SP isolates were determined on nasopharyngeal samples of children aged 3-40 months attending day-care centres, from January to March 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. SP carriage fell from 54{\%} to 45{\%}, and SP with diminished susceptibility to penicillin (PDSP) fell from 34{\%} to 19{\%}. Antibiotic prescriptions dropped from 63{\%} to 38{\%} of children, but third-generation cephalosporins were increasingly prescribed. The overall antibiotic susceptibility increased. Over 90{\%} of the children had received at least one vaccine dose in 2008. Vaccine serotypes 6B, 9V, 19F and 23F (76{\%}) in 1999 were replaced by non-vaccine types (95{\%}) in 2008, among which were 15 (20{\%}), 19A (15{\%}), 23A/B (10{\%}) and 6A (9{\%}). Serotypes 6A, 19A and 15 accounted for over 50{\%} of PDSP strains in 2008 versus 6{\%} in 1999. Children now mostly harbour non-vaccine types; however, PDSP isolates are mainly recruited among these. Vaccine-related benefits may be threatened by combined vaccine- and antibiotic-driven selective pressure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Ministry of Health (MOH), Mongolia, is considering introducing 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in its national immunization programme to prevent the burden of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing PCV13 compared to no PCV vaccination in Mongolia. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of introducing PCV13 compared to no PCV vaccination was assessed using an age-stratified static multiple cohort model. The risk of various clinical presentations of pneumococcal disease (meningitis, pneumonia, non-meningitis non-pneumonia invasive pneumococcal disease and acute otitis media) at all ages for thirty birth cohorts was assessed. The analysis considered both health system and societal perspectives. A 3+0 vaccine schedule and price of US{\$}3.30 per dose was assumed for the baseline scenario based on Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance's advance market commitment tail price. RESULTS: The ICER of PCV13 introduction is estimated at US{\$}52 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted (health system perspective), and cost-saving (societal perspective). Although indirect effects of PCV have been well-documented, a conservative scenario that does not consider indirect effects estimated PCV13 introduction to cost US{\$}79 per DALY averted (health system perspective), and US{\$}19 per DALY averted (societal perspective). Vaccination with PCV13 is expected to cost around US{\$}920,000 in 2016, and thereafter US{\$}820,000 every year. The programme is likely to reduce direct disease-related costs to MOH by US{\$}440,000 in the first year, increasing to US{\$}510,000 by 2025. CONCLUSION: Introducing PCV13 as part of Mongolia's national programme appears to be highly cost-effective when compared to no vaccination and cost-saving from a societal perspective at vaccine purchase prices offered through Gavi. Notwithstanding uncertainties around some parameters, cost-effectiveness of PCV introduction for Mongolia remains robust over a range of conservative scenarios.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Otitis media (OM) in children is the most frequent reason for physician visits in developed countries and burdens caregivers, society, and the child. Our objective was to describe the impact of OM severity on parent/caregiver quality of life (QoL). STUDY DESIGN Multi-institutional prospective cross-sectional study. SETTING Otolaryngology, family, and pediatric practices. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Children 6 to 24 months old with and without a primary diagnosis of recurrent OM and their caregivers. Physicians provided patient history, and parents/caregivers completed a Family Information Form, the PedsQL Family Impact survey, the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) survey, and the OM 6-item severity survey (OM-6). RESULTS A total of 2413 subjects were enrolled and data from 1208 patients and physician were analyzed. The average child age was 16 months, and 54{\{}{\%}{\}} were male. The mean OM-6 score was 3.2. The mean PedsQL Family Impact score for parents was 66.9 from otolaryngology sites and 78.8 from pediatrics/family practice sites (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} .001). Higher (worse) OM-6 scores correlated significantly with worse PedsQL Family Impact scores (Pearson r = -0.512, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} .01). Similarly, increasing OM-6 scores strongly correlated with increased parental anxiety, depression, and fatigue, as well as decreased satisfaction (all P {\{}{\textless}{\}} .01). CONCLUSIONS Worse PedsQL Family Impact and PROMIS scores were highly correlated with elevated OM-6 scores, suggesting that severity of childhood OM significantly affects parent/caregiver QoL. Understanding the impact of a child's illness on parent/caregiver QoL can help physicians counsel patients and families and provide better family-centered, compassionate care.},

abstract = {A seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the Danish childhood immunization program (2+1 schedule) in October 2007, followed by PCV13 starting from April 2010. The nationwide incidence of IPD among children younger than 5 years nearly halved after the introduction of PCV7 in the program, mainly due to a decline in IPD caused by PCV7-serotypes. We report the results from a nationwide population-based cohort study of laboratory confirmed IPD cases in children younger than 5 years during October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010 and describe the characteristics of children suspected to present with a vaccine failure. The period between April 19 and December 31, 2010 was considered a PCV7/PCV13 transitional period, where both vaccines were offered. We identified 45 episodes of IPD caused by a PCV7 serotype (23{\%} of the total number) and 105 (55{\%}) caused by one of the 6 additional serotypes in PCV13. Ten children had received at least one PCV7 dose before the onset of IPD caused by a PCV7 serotype. Seven children were considered to be incompletely vaccinated before IPD, but only three cases fulfilled the criteria of vaccine failure (caused by serotypes 14, 19F and 23F). One case of vaccine failure was observed in a severely immunosuppressed child following three PCV7 doses, and two cases were observed in immunocompetent children following two infant doses before they were eligible for their booster. None of the IPD cases caused by the additional PCV13 serotypes had been vaccinated by PCV13 and there were therefore no PCV13-vaccine failures in the first 8-months after PCV13 introduction in Denmark.},

abstract = {Objectives: Acute otitis media is the single diagnosis responsible for most prescriptions of antibiotics in Sweden and the USA. The treatment of acute otitis media has significant impact on child health, healthcare costs, and the development of anti-microbial resistance. In the Swedish national guidelines from the year 2000, watchful waiting was recommended for most children over 2 years of age. The aims of the present study were to assess the degree of adherence to acute otitis media guidelines at a busy pediatric emergency department of a university hospital and to determine whether an information campaign changed the result. Methods: Audit of 91 patient records before and 80 patient records after an information campaign consisting of an oral presentation, posting of flow charts, and sending of educational material to prescribing physicians. Four endpoints were studied: choosing to use antibiotics, choice of antibiotic, dosage of antibiotic, and duration of treatment. Results: Before the information campaign, adherence to guidelines was between 70{\%} (dosage) and around 90{\%} (duration). No significant change was seen after the information campaign. The endpoint choosing to use antibiotics showed a large divergence in adherence in children under 2 years (96{\%}) compared to older children (39{\%}). Conclusions: Overall adherence to recommendations was 70-90{\%} but adherence to watchful waiting was poor. Information did not improve adherence, suggesting insufficient educational power or the existence of barriers other than lack of knowledge. Specific barriers should be identified, and implementation and follow-up should be part of producing guidelines in order to achieve the desired results. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otorrhea is a common problem in children with tympanostomy tubes. We recently demonstrated that treatment with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops is clinically superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of these three common treatment strategies for this condition. METHODS We performed an open-label pragmatic trial in which 230 children with acute uncomplicated tympanostomy-tube otorrhea were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 3 treatments: hydrocortisone-bacitracin-colistin eardrops, oral amoxicillin-clavulanate suspension, and initial observation (no assigned medication prescription to fill). Parents kept a daily diary capturing ear-related symptoms, health care resource use, and non-health care costs for 6 months. At 2 weeks and 6 months, the study doctor visited the children at home performing otoscopy. Using a societal perspective, treatment failure (otoscopic presence of otorrhea at 2 weeks) and number of days with otorrhea as reported in the daily diary were balanced against the costs. RESULTS Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were clinically superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation both at 2 weeks and 6 months. At 2 weeks, mean total cost per patient was US{\$}42.43 for antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops, US{\$}70.60 for oral antibiotics, and US{\$}82.03 for initial observation. At 6 months, mean total cost per patient was US{\$}368.20, US{\$}420.73, and US{\$}640.44, respectively. Because of the dominance of eardrops, calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was redundant. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops are clinically superior and cost less than oral antibiotics and initial observation in children with tympanostomy tubes who develop otorrhea.},

Pneumococcal disease is roughly divided into non-invasive and invasive disease. The burden of non-invasive pneumococcal disease in adults is mainly determined by community-acquired pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia has high incidence rates and carries a high mortality risk, especially in the elderly. Within the cluster of invasive pneumococcal diseases, pneumonia also represents the most common infectious source. Incidence and mortality rates of both non-invasive and invasive disease have changed as a result of pneumococcal vaccination in children. However, especially elderly patients with comorbidities remain vulnerable to morbidity and mortality caused by pneumococcal disease. The current review summarizes the current knowledge on the epidemiology including outcome of the main clinical forms of pneumococcal disease, with a special focus on elderly patients. Furthermore, the economic burden and future vaccine strategies are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gambia is the second GAVI support-eligible country to introduce the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), but a country-specific cost-effectiveness analysis of the vaccine is not available. Our objective was to assess the potential impact of PCVs of different valences in The Gambia. METHODS: We synthesized the best available epidemiological and cost data using a state-transition model to simulate the natural histories of various pneumococcal diseases. For the base-case, we estimated incremental cost (in 2005 US dollars) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted under routine vaccination using PCV9 compared to no vaccination. We extended the base-case results for PCV9 to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13, each compared to no vaccination. To explore parameter uncertainty, we performed both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We also explored the impact of vaccine efficacy waning, herd immunity, and serotype replacement, as a part of the uncertainty analyses, by assuming alternative scenarios and extrapolating empirical results from different settings. RESULTS: Assuming 90{\%} coverage, a program using a 9-valent PCV (PCV9) would prevent approximately 630 hospitalizations, 40 deaths, and 1000 DALYs, over the first 5 years of life of a birth cohort. Under base-case assumptions ({\$}3.5 per vaccine), compared to no intervention, a PCV9 vaccination program would cost {\$}670 per DALY averted in The Gambia. The corresponding values for PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 were {\$}910, {\$}670, and {\$}570 per DALY averted, respectively. Sensitivity analyses that explored the implications of the uncertain key parameters showed that model outcomes were most sensitive to vaccine price per dose, discount rate, case-fatality rate of primary endpoint pneumonia, and vaccine efficacy against primary endpoint pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the information available now, infant PCV vaccination would be expected to reduce pneumococcal diseases caused by S. pneumoniae in The Gambia. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of three times GDP per capita, all PCVs examined would be cost-effective at the tentative Advance Market Commitment (AMC) price of {\$}3.5 per dose. Because the cost-effectiveness of a PCV program could be affected by potential serotype replacement or herd immunity effects that may not be known until after a large scale introduction, type-specific surveillance and iterative evaluation will be critical.},

The effect of antimicrobial treatment on the duration of middle ear effusion (MEE) and concomitant hearing impairment is not known. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the antimicrobial treatment of AOM reduces the duration of MEE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved a total of 84 children with AOM between 6 months and 15 years of age. Participants were recruited from September 14, 1999, to January 4, 2000; October 10, 2005, to December 16, 2005; and September 22, 2009, to June 4, 2012, from among children attending an AOM prevention trial and children visiting local outpatient clinics in Oulu, Finland. INTERVENTIONS Children were randomly allocated to receive either 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin-clavulanate or a placebo mixture per day for 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the time to the disappearance of MEE as defined by a normal tympanogram finding (A curve) from both ears on 2 consecutive measurement days. Parents performed daily tympanometry at home. The study physician performed tympanometry and otoscopy at study entry, after 3 and 7 days, and then weekly until both ears were healthy. The main secondary outcome measures were the time to normal otoscopy findings and the proportion of children without persistent MEE at 14 days and 2 months. RESULTS Middle ear effusion disappeared 2.0 weeks (13.7 days) earlier (P = .02) in the antimicrobial group (mean time, 2.7 weeks; 95{\%} CI, 1.7-3.7) than in the placebo group (4.7 weeks; 95{\%} CI, 3.6-5.7). Normal otoscopy findings were observed 1.4 weeks sooner in the antimicrobial group than in the placebo group (P = .02). On day 14, 69{\%} of children in the antimicrobial group and 38{\%} in the placebo group had normal tympanometry findings (number needed to treat, 3.2; 95{\%} CI, 2.0-10.5). On day 60, 2 children (5{\%}) in the antimicrobial group and 10 children (24{\%}) in the placebo group had persistent MEE (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antimicrobial treatment effectively reduced the duration of MEE and possible concomitant hearing impairment in children with AOM. Antimicrobial treatment also reduced the risk for persistent MEE. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01244581.},

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2005, a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) for non-Indigenous children and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) for non-Indigenous adults aged ≥ 65 years were made freely available. Trends in IPD in the non-Indigenous estimated resident population in north Queensland (about 581 850 in 2006) were compared between the 4 years before (2001-2004) and after (2006-2009) the vaccines were rolled out. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidences and serotypes of IPD in non-Indigenous people. RESULTS: After the introduction of the vaccines, there were significant declines for all ages in the average annual incidence of IPD (- 34{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05) and 7vPCV serotype IPD (- 77{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05). In children aged {\textless} 5 years, there was a 91{\%} decline in the incidence of 7vPCV serotype IPD (P {\textless} 0.05); in adults aged 15-64 years and ≥ 65 years there were 62{\%} and 77{\%} declines, respectively, in 7vPCV and 23vPPV common-serotype IPD (P {\textless} 0.05). There was a 188{\%} increase in 23vPPV-only serotype IPD in adults aged 15-64 years (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas there was no significant change in adults aged ≥ 65 years. Serotype 19A was the most frequently identified serotype in 2006-2009, causing 19{\%} of all IPD in those 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: There is circumstantial evidence that 7vPCV has had a powerful indirect effect in preventing IPD in adults in north Queensland; 23vPPV may have had a direct effect in adults aged ≥ 65 years. It is likely that with combined direct and indirect effects, newer conjugate vaccines could prevent more IPD than could be prevented with the two current vaccines.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: England and Wales recently replaced the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) with its 13-valent equivalent (PCV13), partly based on projections from mathematical models of the long-term impact of such a switch compared to ceasing pneumococcal conjugate vaccination altogether. METHODS: A compartmental deterministic model was used to estimate parameters governing transmission of infection and competition between different groups of pneumococcal serotypes prior to the introduction of PCV13. The best-fitting parameters were used in an individual based model to describe pneumococcal transmission dynamics and effects of various options for the vaccination programme change in England and Wales. A number of scenarios were conducted using (i) different assumptions about the number of invasive pneumococcal disease cases adjusted for the increasing trend in disease incidence prior to PCV7 introduction in England and Wales, and (ii) a range of values representing serotype replacement induced by vaccination of the additional six serotypes in PCV13. RESULTS: Most of the scenarios considered suggest that ceasing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use would cause an increase in invasive pneumococcal disease incidence, while replacing PCV7 with PCV13 would cause an overall decrease. However, the size of this reduction largely depends on the level of competition induced by the additional serotypes in PCV13. The model estimates that over 20 years of PCV13 vaccination, around 5000-62000 IPD cases could be prevented compared to stopping pneumococcal conjugate vaccination altogether. CONCLUSION: Despite inevitable uncertainty around serotype replacement effects following introduction of PCV13, the model suggests a reduction in overall invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in all cases. Our results provide useful evidence on the benefits of PCV13 to countries replacing or considering replacing PCV7 with PCV13, as well as data that can be used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such a switch.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is a burgeoning problem, with rates of antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD, in particular, increasing during the past decade. One measure to combat IPD is vaccination with the recently introduced 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). METHODS: To evaluate the effects of the introduction of PCV in 2000 on the epidemiology of antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD, a database of IPD cases from January 1995 through December 2002 identified through active surveillance in 5 Tennessee counties was examined. For each case, clinical data were collected, and antibiotic susceptibility testing and serotyping were performed on available isolates. RESULTS: Among children younger than 2 years, IPD rates peaked at 235 cases per 100,000 in 1999 before decreasing, after PCV licensure, to 46 cases per 100,000 in 2002 (P{\textless}.001). The proportion of penicillin-nonsusceptible IPD isolates from this age group declined from 59.8{\%} in 1999 to 30.4{\%} in 2002 (P{\textless}.01). After 2001, similar decreases in IPD rates and in the proportion of antibiotic-nonsusceptible isolates recovered were seen among persons aged 2 years and older (P{\textless}.01). Rates of IPD due to PCV-associated serotypes declined after PCV introduction in all age groups (P{\textless}.001), whereas the rate of IPD due to nonvaccine serotypes increased among persons aged 2 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: In the 2 years since licensure, widespread PCV vaccination of children has resulted in dramatic declines in the proportion of antibiotic-nonsusceptible isolates in Tennessee. PCV vaccination of children also appears to be a highly effective method for reducing the burden of IPD in adults.},

abstract = {Penicillin-resistant pneumococci were first reported in Australia in 1967 and appeared in the UK in 1976. Their prevalence is increasing but varies greatly worldwide. The mechanism of resistance lies in the alteration of penicillin-binding proteins. Penicillin-resistant strains are often also resistant to a variety of non-beta-lactam antibiotics. Many different serotypes have been found to be penicillin resistant, type 23 being the most common resistant serotype in the UK. Use of oxacillin discs is recommended for penicillin sensitivity testing, otherwise resistant isolates may escape detection. Treatment of infected patients depends on several factors including the degree of resistance of the infecting strain, the sensitivity to alternative agents and the achievable concentration of antibiotic at the site of the infection. Carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci is more common in children, especially the recently hospitalized and those recently exposed to antibiotics. Outbreaks of infection have occurred and various control measures have been suggested in attempts to limit the spread of resistant strains.},

We aim to describe specific scenarios in which randomised trials may not be possible and describe, exemplify and assess alternative strategies. Methods: Non-systematic exploratory review. Results: In many scenarios barriers are surmountable so that randomised trials (including stepped-wedge and crossover trials) are possible. It is possible to rank alternative designs but context will also determine which choices are preferable. Evidence from non-randomised designs is more convincing when confounders are well-understood, measured and controlled; there is evidence for causal pathways linking intervention and outcomes and/or against other pathways explaining outcomes; and effect sizes are large. Conclusion: Non-randomised trials might provide adequate evidence to inform decisions when interventions are demonstrably feasible and acceptable, and where evidence suggests there is little potential for harm, but caution that such designs may not provide adequate evidence when intervention feasibility or acceptability is doubtful, and where existing evidence suggests benefits may be marginal and/or harms possible.},

We systematically reviewed studies on all-cause AOM episodes and physician visits in which impact was attributed to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, either as efficacy or effectiveness. Of 18 relevant publications found, most used the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vCRM). The efficacy of 7vCRM against all-cause AOM episodes or visits was 0{\%}-9{\%} in randomized trials and 17{\%}-23{\%} in nonrandomized trials. In observational database studies, physician visits for AOM were already declining in the 3-5 years before 7vCRM introduction (mean change, -15{\%}; range, +14{\%} to -24{\%}) and continued to decline afterward (mean, -19{\%}; range, +7{\%} to -48{\%}). This vaccine provides some protection against OM, but other factors have also contributed to the recent decline in OM incidence. Future effectiveness studies should thus use better-controlled methods to estimate the true impact of vaccination on AOM.},

abstract = {Unmeasured confounding may undermine the validity of causal inference with observational studies. Sensitivity analysis provides an attractive way to partially circumvent this issue by assessing the potential influence of unmeasured confounding on the causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity analysis approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as having a confounder that is binary, or having no interaction between the effects of the exposure and the confounder on the outcome, or having only one confounder. Without imposing any assumptions on the confounder or confounders, we derive a bounding factor and a sharp inequality such that the sensitivity analysis parameters must satisfy the inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to explain away the observed effect estimate or reduce it to a particular level. Our approach is easy to implement and involves only two sensitivity parameters. Surprisingly, our bounding factor, which makes no simplifying assumptions, is no more conservative than a number of previous sensitivity analysis techniques that do make assumptions. Our new bounding factor implies not only the traditional Cornfield conditions that both the relative risk of the exposure on the confounder and that of the confounder on the outcome must satisfy, but also a high threshold that the maximum of these relative risks must satisfy. Furthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed as a measure of the strength of confounding between the exposure and the outcome induced by a confounder.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND This paper describes challenges in etiologic diagnosis and treatment of childhood community-acquired pneumonia and the means of addressing some of them. MICROBIOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS From about one-third to two-thirds of cases of pneumonia can be attributed to a specific etiology depending on which culture, antigen detection and specialized serologic techniques, some of which are unavailable to clinicians, are used. Results of studies in which microbiologic causes have been sought confirm the importance of Streptococcus pneumoniae as the primary bacterial cause of pneumonia in infants and children. Viral etiologies become less prevalent and mycoplasmal and chlamydial infections become more prevalent with increasing age. EMPIRIC TREATMENT Because definitive information about causative pathogens is seldom available, treatment of pneumonia is most often empiric. Antibiotic therapy can be withheld in mildly ill, ambulatory patients in whom viral infection is likely. Most guidelines suggest initial treatment with orally administered amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate or with intravenous cefuroxime when patients require hospitalization. In May, 2000, the Centers for Disease Control-convened Drug-Resistant S. pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group identified oral beta-lactams including cefuroxime axetil, amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate as appropriate options for first line therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in ambulatory adults and children. CONCLUSIONS New diagnostic techniques such as pneumococcal serologies and polymerase chain reaction testing have improved the ability to determine the microbiologic etiology of childhood pneumonia. Because these tests are not generally available, empiric treatment is necessary. Efforts to identify new intervention strategies, diagnostic tools, therapies and vaccines will be helpful in managing this disease.},

The optimal schedule to maximize protection of vaccinated children against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (VT-IPD) is not known.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: To assess the relative benefit of various PCV dosing schedules, we conducted a systematic review of studies published in English from 1994 to 2010 (supplemented post hoc with studies from 2011) on PCV effectiveness against VT-IPD among children targeted to receive vaccine. Data on 2-dose and 3-dose primary series, both with and without a booster ("2+0," "2+1," "3+0" and "3+1"), were included. For observational studies using surveillance data or case counts, we calculated percentage reduction in VT-IPD before and after PCV introduction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 4 randomized controlled trials and 31 observational studies reporting VT-IPD among young children, none evaluated a 2+0 complete series, 7 (19{\%}) evaluated 2+1, 4 (11{\%}) 3+0 and 27 (75{\%}) 3+1. Most (86{\%}) studies were from North America or Europe. Only 1 study (observational) directly compared 2 schedules (3+0 vs. 3+1); results supported the use of a booster dose. In clinical trials, vaccine efficacy ranged from 65{\%} to 71{\%} with 3+0 and 83{\%} to 94{\%} with 3+1. Surveillance data and case counts demonstrate reductions in VT-IPD of up to 100{\%} with 2+1 (6 studies) or 3+1 (17 studies) schedules and up to 90{\%} with 3+0 (2 studies). Reductions were observed as early as 1 year after PCV introduction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of 2+1, 3+0 and 3+1 schedules, although most data of PCV impact on VT-IPD among young children are from high-income countries using 3+1. Differences between schedules for impact on VT-IPD are difficult to discern based on available data.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) account for a high proportion of ICU admissions, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the main pathogen responsible for these infections. However, little is known on the clinical features and outcomes of ICU patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The aims of this study were to provide epidemiological data and to determine risk factors of mortality in patients admitted to ICU for severe S. pneumoniae CAP. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of two prospectively-acquired multicentre ICU databases (2001-2008). Patients admitted for management of severe pneumococcal CAP were enrolled if they met the 2001 American Thoracic Society criteria for severe pneumonia, had life-threatening organ failure and had a positive microbiological sample for S. pneumoniae. Patients with bronchitis, aspiration pneumonia or with non-pulmonary pneumococcal infections were excluded. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty two patients were included, with a median SAPS II score reaching 47 [36-64]. Acute respiratory failure (n = 154) and septic shock (n = 54) were their most frequent causes of ICU admission. Septic shock occurred in 170 patients (77{\%}) and mechanical ventilation was required in 186 patients (84{\%}); renal replacement therapy was initiated in 70 patients (32{\%}). Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 101 patients. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 39.7{\%}. Although antibiotherapy was adequate in 92.3{\%} of cases, hospital mortality reached 28.8{\%}. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were age (OR 1.05 (95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.08)), male sex (OR 2.83 (95{\%} CI: 1.16-6.91)) and renal replacement therapy (OR 3.78 (95{\%} CI: 1.71-8.36)). Co-morbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU, mortality of pneumococcal CAP remains high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment. Baseline demographic data and renal replacement therapy have a major impact on adverse outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As expected, the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) had a significant impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children. In addition to the substantial decline in IPD, increased disease due to nonvaccine serotypes and a changing clinical presentation emerged. The objective of this study is to describe these trends in IPD in the late PCV7-era.

METHODS: We report on continued, prospective, population-based surveillance of childhood IPD in Massachusetts children during the period 2007 to 2009 and make comparisons with the earlier 2001 to 2006 PCV7-era. Demographic and clinical data were collected for all cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from normally sterile sites were serotyped and further evaluated using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing and eBURST analysis. IPD incidence rates are calculated by age, year and serotype.

RESULTS: There were 326 cases of IPD between 2007 and 2009 in children {\textless} 18 years of age. Overall IPD incidence rate was 7.5 cases per 100,000 population and was not statistically different from the observed incidence in 2001 to 2006 (P {\textgreater} 0.05). As compared with the earlier period, the proportion of bacteremic pneumonia among all IPD cases was almost 3-fold greater in 2009 to 2010 (P {\textless} 0.01). PCV7 serotypes accounted for 7{\%}, whereas the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes accounted for 77{\%} of all cases between 2007 and 2009. IPD due to serotypes 19A and 7F increased, and 19A and 7F were isolated in 41{\%} and 20{\%} of all IPD cases in the same period, respectively. Serotype 19A also comprised a majority of the penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. Analysis of multilocus sequence typing data showed a significant increase in ST191, ST695 and ST320 and a significant decrease in ST199 and ST180.

CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in IPD after introduction of PCV7 persists in Massachusetts children; however, serotypes causing IPD have changed significantly in the last decade. Continued surveillance is necessary to determine the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, as well as track potential changes in disease incidence and character due to non-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation in the absence of rheumatic valvular disease is associated with a fivefold to sevenfold increased risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study, a multicenter, randomized trial, compared 325 mg/day aspirin (double-blind) or warfarin with placebo for prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events), and included 1,330 inpatients and outpatients with constant or intermittent atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, the rate of primary events in patients assigned to placebo was 6.3{\%} per year and was reduced by 42{\%} in those assigned to aspirin (3.6{\%} per year; p = 0.02; 95{\%} confidence interval, 9-63{\%}). In the subgroup of warfarin-eligible patients (most less than 76 years old), warfarin dose-adjusted to prolong prothrombin time to 1.3-fold to 1.8-fold that of control reduced the risk of primary events by 67{\%} (warfarin versus placebo, 2.3{\%} versus 7.4{\%} per year; p = 0.01; 95{\%} confidence interval, 27-85{\%}). Primary events or death were reduced 58{\%} (p = 0.01) by warfarin and 32{\%} (p = 0.02) by aspirin. The risk of significant bleeding was 1.5{\%}, 1.4{\%}, and 1.6{\%} per year in patients assigned to warfarin, aspirin, and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Aspirin and warfarin are both effective in reducing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because warfarin-eligible patients composed a subset of all aspirin-eligible patients, the magnitude of reduction in events by warfarin versus aspirin cannot be compared. Too few events occurred in warfarin-eligible patients to directly assess the relative benefit of aspirin compared with warfarin, and the trial is continuing to address this issue. Patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who can safely take either aspirin or warfarin should receive prophylactic antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke.},

METHODS Eight hospitals, accounting for 33{\%} of hospitalizations in Israel, provided data on BSI during 2006-2010. The age-specific incidence of BSI due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes was determined. BSI incidence rate ratios (IRRs) during seasonal and pH1N1 influenza seasons were assessed. RESULTS Regular influenza seasons were characterized by increased rates of S. pneumoniae BSI but with no increase in S. aureus and S. pyogenes BSI rates. The pH1N1/2009-2010 influenza outbreak was characterized by (1) higher rates of S. pneumoniae bacteremia among children but not among adults (IRRs for S. pneumoniae BSI among children aged 0-4 years during the summer and winter of 2009-2010 were 14.8 [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, 5-43.7] and 6.5 [95{\%} CI, 3.6-11.8], compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active winter weeks, respectively [P {\textless} .0001]), higher rates of S. aureus BSI in all age groups (IRRs during the summer and winter of 2009-2010 were 1.6 [95{\%} CI, 1.4-1.9] and 1.5 [95{\%} CI, 1.2-1.7], compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active weeks, respectively [P {\textless} .0001]), higher rates of S. pyogenes BSI during 2009-2010 influenza season (IRR 2.7 [95{\%} CI, 1.6-4.6] and 3.3 [95{\%} CI, 1.9-5.8] during the summer and winter of 2009-2010, compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active weeks, respectively [P {\textless} .0001]).

abstract = {Abstract Conclusions: Staphylococcus species were the most common bacterial isolates from patients with otitis media with effusion (OME). Unexpectedly, however, there was no difference in the identity or antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolated from patients with recurrent and non-recurrent OME. Objectives: Antibiotic resistance has increased due to indiscriminate overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Bacterial strains isolated from patients with recurrent OME seem to be more pathogenic and more resistant to antibiotics than strains isolated from patients with non-recurrent OME. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in identity and antibiotic sensitivity profiles of bacterial strains isolated from patients with recurrent and non-recurrent OME. Methods: We collected 900 middle ear fluid (MEF) samples from 654 pediatric patients who underwent ventilation tube insertion due to OME, then compared the identity and antibiotic sensitivity profiles of bacterial strains. Recurrent OME was defined as a requirement for ventilation tube reinsertion after tube extrusion. Results: There was no difference in the identity of bacterial isolates from patients with non-recurrent and recurrent OME regardless of the number of ventilation tubes inserted. Antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that the two groups differed in sensitivity to penicillin and erythromycin, but not to other antibiotics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal pneumonia causes significant morbidity and mortality among adults. Given limitations of diagnostic tests for non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, most studies report the incidence of bacteremic or invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and thus, grossly underestimate the pneumococcal pneumonia burden. We aimed to develop a conceptual and quantitative strategy to estimate the non-bacteremic disease burden among adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using systematic study methods and the availability of a urine antigen assay.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a systematic literature review of studies providing information on the relative yield of various diagnostic assays (BinaxNOW{\textregistered} S. pneumoniae urine antigen test (UAT) with blood and/or sputum culture) in diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia. We estimated the proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia that is bacteremic, the proportion of CAP attributable to pneumococcus, and the additional contribution of the Binax UAT beyond conventional diagnostic techniques, using random effects meta-analytic methods and bootstrapping. We included 35 studies in the analysis, predominantly from developed countries. The estimated proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia that is bacteremic was 24.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 21.3{\%}, 28.9{\%}). The estimated proportion of CAP attributable to pneumococcus was 27.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 23.9{\%}, 31.1{\%}). The Binax UAT diagnosed an additional 11.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 9.6, 13.6{\%}) of CAP beyond conventional techniques. We were limited by the fact that not all patients underwent all diagnostic tests and by the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests themselves. We address these resulting biases and provide a range of plausible values in order to estimate the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia among adults.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Estimating the adult burden of pneumococcal disease from bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia data alone significantly underestimates the true burden of disease in adults. For every case of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, we estimate that there are at least 3 additional cases of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.},

abstract = {Pneumococcal carriage and resistance vary markedly among communities and are not fully explained by individual predictors. Community risk factors may explain this variation. The authors geocoded addresses from a multicommunity sample of 710 Massachusetts children previously swabbed for pneumococcal carriage in 2001. Using regression models, the authors evaluated associations between census tract measures and pneumococcal carriage or resistance. Living in census tracts with an average household size of more than 2.9 predicted carriage (odds ratio = 3.0, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.7, 5.5), and living in socioeconomically disadvantaged census tracts conferred an additional two- to threefold odds of carriage equal to attending child care. Living in a census tract with a median household income of less than {\$}35,000 predicted carriage among nonattendees (odds ratio = 2.7, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.7, 4.3). The predictive value of a low-income census tract was interchangeable with any of several socioeconomic measures, including poverty, unemployment, low educational attainment, and low owner occupancy, in addition to high density of children and limited household plumbing facilities. Furthermore, living in census tracts with low educational attainment significantly predicted resistance (odds ratio = 4.0, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.3, 12.7) and was interchangeable with a high density of children (odds ratio = 3.5, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.0, 11.7). The two- to threefold odds of pneumococcal carriage conferred by certain community characteristics suggest that these measures may target communities for interventions to decrease transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) vary from country to country. Geographical variations together with differences in study designs, reporting and settings play a role. We assessed the incidence of AOM in Italian children seen by primary care paediatricians (PCPs), and described the methods used to diagnose the disease. METHODS This secondary data analysis from the Pedianet database considered children aged 0-6 years between 01/2003 and 12/2007. The AOM episodes were identified and validated by means of patient diaries. Incidence rates/100 person-years (PY) were calculated for total AOM and for single or recurrent AOM. RESULTS The 92,373 children (52.1{\%} males) were followed up for a total of 227,361 PY: 23,039 (24.9{\%}) presented 38,241 episodes of AOM (94.6{\%} single episodes and 5.4{\%} recurrent episodes). The total incidence rate of AOM in the 5-year period was 16.8 episodes per 100 PY (95{\%} CI: 16.7-16.9), including single AOM (15.9 episodes per 100 PY; 95{\%} CI: 15.7-16.1) and recurrent AOM (0.9 episodes per 100 PY; 95{\%} CI: 0.9-0.9). There was a slight and continuously negative trend decrease over time (annual percent change -4.6{\%}; 95{\%}CI: -5.3, -3.9{\%}). The AOM incidence rate varied with age, peaking in children aged 3 to 4 years (22.2 episodes per 100 PY; 95{\%} CI 21.8-22.7). The vast majority of the AOM episodes (36,842/38,241, 96.3{\%}) were diagnosed using a static otoscope; a pneumatic otoscope was used in only 3.7{\%}. CONCLUSIONS Our data fill a gap in our knowledge of the incidence of AOM in Italy, and indicate that AOM represents a considerable burden for the Italian PCP system. Educational programmes concerning the diagnosis of AOM are needed, as are further studies to monitor the incidence in relation to the introduction of wider pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is closely associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections, but the most common microbial agent found in the middle ear fluid during AOM is Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pnc). Pnc is also a common colonizer of the nasopharynx, and its prevalence is further increased during the viral infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between viral infection, pneumococcal acquisition and carriage in the development of Pnc AOM. METHODS: Pnc carriage was assessed in a longitudinal study of 329 infants at scheduled visits at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months of age (N = 1715). The clinical outcome of the first episode of respiratory infection ("sick visit," N = 774) in the following 3-month period was recorded. The occurrence and timing of Pnc AOM in relation to serotype specific carriage at the start of the observation period were assessed. RESULTS: The occurrence, timing and duration of symptoms of the sick visits or the frequency of overall AOM were not associated with preceding pneumococcal carriage. Pnc AOM was in each case associated with concurrent carriage and 3.8 times (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.4-10.0) more often with carriage acquired after the start of the observation period than with carriage already present at the scheduled visit. In all, 79{\%} (55 of 70) of Pnc AOM events were caused by a serotype acquired after the start of the period. CONCLUSION: The majority of Pnc AOM events develop in association with newly acquired carriage of pneumococcus.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME. PURPOSE The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients {\textless}2 months or {\textgreater}12 years old. ACTION STATEMENTS The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child {\textless}4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.},

abstract = {Key Clinical Points Differential Diagnosis of Supraventricular Tachycardias The initial differential diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardias should focus on the ventricular response characteristics of regularity, rate, and rapidity of onset, not on the atrial depolarization from the ECG. The regular supraventricular tachycardias include sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. The irregular supraventricular tachycardias are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter with variable atrioventricular block, and multifocal atrial tachycardia; multiple atrial premature contractions can cause a similar presentation. Sudden onset and termination are characteristic of acute atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. Gradual onset and recession occur with sinus tachycardia, chronic atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia, and atrial premature contractions. Adenosine blocks the atrioventricular node and is useful in distinguishing among supraventricular tachycardias but should not be given in the case of irregular wide-complex tachycardias, since it may render these rhythms unstable. After administration of adenosine, slowing of the heart rate is consistent with a diagnosis of sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter, whereas termination of tachycardia points to atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and some atrial tachycardias.},

abstract = {Objective: Since the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-10) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) were recently licensed for use in Argentina, both vaccines were evaluated to estimate the costs, health benefits and cost-effectiveness of adding a PCV to the routine child immunization schedule. Methodology: The integrated TRIVAC vaccine cost-effectiveness model from Pan American Health Organization's ProVac Initiative (Version 1.0.65) was used to assess the health outcomes of 20 successive cohorts from birth to 5 years of age. PCV-10 and PCV-13 were each compared to a scenario assuming no PCV vaccination. A 3 + 1 (three doses + booster) schedule and a vaccination price of US{\$} 20.75 per dose was assumed in the base case for both vaccines. Results: Introduction of PCV-13 rather than PCV-10 would increase the number of life years gained (LYG) by at least 10{\%}. The number of LYG (and LYG after adjustment for DALY morbidity weights) was 56,882 (64,252) for PCV-10 compared to 65,038 (71,628) for PCV-13. From the health system perspective, the cost per DALY averted was US{\$} 8973 and US{\$} 10,948 for PCV-10 and PCV-13 respectively, and US{\$} 8546 and US{\$} 10,510 respectively, after incorporating costs saved by households. When PCV13 was compared to PCV10 directly, the additional benefits of PCV-13 was conferred at a cost of US{\$} 28,147 per DALY averted. Cost-effectiveness was influenced mainly by vaccine price, serotype replacement, pneumonia mortality and discount rate. Conclusion: Routine vaccination against S. pneumoniae in Argentina would be cost-effective with either PCV-10 or PCV-13. PCV-13, with higher coverage of local serotypes, would prevent more cases of pneumonia, invasive pneumococcal disease, sequelae and deaths with a higher number of LYG and DALYs averted, but PCV-10, due its higher impact in the prevention of AOM, would save more costs to the healthcare system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae is thought to be induced by exposure to S. pneumoniae or cross-reactive antigens. No longitudinal studies of carriage of and immune responses to S. pneumoniae have been conducted using sophisticated immunological laboratory techniques. METHODS: We enrolled 121 families with young children into this study. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected monthly for 10 months from all family members and were cultured in a standard fashion. Cultured S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped. At the beginning (month 0) and end (month 10) of the study, venous blood was collected from family members {\textgreater}18 years old. Serotype-specific antipolysaccharide immunoglobulin G (IgG) and functional antibody and antibodies to pneumolysin, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), and pneumococcal surface antigen A (PsaA) were measured in paired serum samples. RESULTS: Levels of anticapsular IgG increased significantly after carriage of serotypes 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F by an individual or family member. For serotype 14, a higher level of anticapsular IgG at the beginning of the study was associated with reduced odds of carriage (P = .006). There was a small (approximately 20{\%}) but significant increase in titers of antibodies to PsaA and pneumolysin but no change in titers of antibody to PspA. CONCLUSIONS: Adults respond to NP carriage by mounting anticapsular and weak antiprotein antibody responses, and naturally induced anticapsular IgG can prevent carriage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive pneumococcal disease continues to be an important cause of mortality. In Calgary, 60{\%} of deaths occur within 5 days of presenting to hospital. This proportion has not changed since before the era of penicillin. The purpose of this study was to investigate what factors may influence death within 5 days of presentation with pneumococcal disease.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Demographic and clinical data from the CASPER (Calgary Area Streptococcus pneumoniae Epidemiology Research) study on 1065 episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults (≥18 years) from 2000 to 2010 were analyzed. Adjusted multinomial regression was performed to analyze 3 outcomes: early mortality ({\textless}5 days post-presentation), late mortality (5-30 days post-presentation), and survival, generating relative risk ratios (RRR). Patients with severe disease had increased risk of early and late death. In multinomial regression with survivors as baseline, the risk of early death increased in those with a Charlson index ≥2 (RRR: 6.3, 95{\%} CI: 1.8-21.9); the risk of late death increased in those with less severe disease and a Charlson ≥2 (RRR: 6.1, 95{\%} CI: 1.4-27.7). Patients who never received appropriate antibiotics had 5.6X (95{\%} CI: 2.4-13.1) the risk of early death. Risk of both early and late death increased by a RRR of 1.3 (95{\%} CI: 1.2-1.4) per 5-year increase in age. In multinomial regression, there were no significant differences in the effects of the factors tested between early and late mortality.

CONCLUSIONS: Presenting with severe invasive pneumococcal disease, multiple comorbidities, and older age increases the risk of both early and late death. Patients who died early often presented too late for effective antibiotic therapy, highlighting the need for an effective vaccine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous trials have shown that among high-risk patients with aortic stenosis, survival rates are similar with transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic-valve replacement. We evaluated the two procedures in a randomized trial involving intermediate-risk patients. METHODS We randomly assigned 2032 intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, at 57 centers, to undergo either TAVR or surgical replacement. The primary end point was death from any cause or disabling stroke at 2 years. The primary hypothesis was that TAVR would not be inferior to surgical replacement. Before randomization, patients were entered into one of two cohorts on the basis of clinical and imaging findings; 76.3{\%} of the patients were included in the transfemoral-access cohort and 23.7{\%} in the transthoracic-access cohort. RESULTS The rate of death from any cause or disabling stroke was similar in the TAVR group and the surgery group (P=0.001 for noninferiority). At 2 years, the Kaplan-Meier event rates were 19.3{\%} in the TAVR group and 21.1{\%} in the surgery group (hazard ratio in the TAVR group, 0.89; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.09; P=0.25). In the transfemoral-access cohort, TAVR resulted in a lower rate of death or disabling stroke than surgery (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95{\%} CI, 0.62 to 1.00; P=0.05), whereas in the transthoracic-access cohort, outcomes were similar in the two groups. TAVR resulted in larger aortic-valve areas than did surgery and also resulted in lower rates of acute kidney injury, severe bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation; surgery resulted in fewer major vascular complications and less paravalvular aortic regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS In intermediate-risk patients, TAVR was similar to surgical aortic-valve replacement with respect to the primary end point of death or disabling stroke.

abstract = {Context Little is known about how health insurance status affects decisions to seek care during emergency medical conditions such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Objective To examine the association between lack of health insurance and financial concerns about accessing care among those with health insurance, and the time from symptom onset to hospital presentation (prehospital delays) during AMI. Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, prospective study using a registry of 3721 AMI patients enrolled between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, at 24 US hospitals. Health insurance status was categorized as insured without financial concerns, insured but have financial concerns about accessing care, and uninsured. Insurance information was determined from medical records while financial concerns among those with health insurance were determined from structured interviews. Main Outcome Measure Prehospital delay times (≤2 hours, {\textgreater}2-6 hours, or {\textgreater}6 hours), adjusted for demographic, clinical, and social and psychological factors using hierarchical ordinal regression models. Results Of 3721 patients, 2294 were insured without financial concerns (61.7{\%}), 689 were insured but had financial concerns about accessing care (18.5{\%}), and 738 were uninsured (19.8{\%}). Uninsured and insured patients with financial concerns were more likely to delay seeking care during AMI and had prehospital delays of greater than 6 hours among 48.6{\%} of uninsured patients and 44.6{\%} of insured patients with financial concerns compared with only 39.3{\%} of insured patients without financial concerns. Prehospital delays of less than 2 hours during AMI occurred among 36.6{\%} of those insured without financial concerns compared with 33.5{\%} of insured patients with financial concerns and 27.5{\%} of uninsured patients (P {\textless} .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, prehospital delays were associated with insured patients with financial concerns (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.05-1.41]; P = .01) and with uninsured patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.17-1.63]; P {\textless} .001). Conclusion Lack of health insurance and financial concerns about accessing care among those with health insurance were each associated with delays in seeking emergency care for AMI.},

Rapid typing methods thus became very important, and type-specific serum therapy generated a dramatic decrease in the number of deaths from pneumococcal pneumonia. Just before the introduction of sulfonamides and, shortly thereafter, penicillin, the use of horse sera was replaced by the use of rabbit sera for a number of reasons. The present methods of typing comprise the capsular reaction test, latex- and coagglutination, and capillary precipitation, to name the most important; these use a large variety of antisera.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The volume and patterns of antimicrobial drug use are key variables to consider when developing guidelines for prescribing, and programs to address stewardship and combat the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Because drug programs are regulated at the provincial level, there is an expectation that antibiotic use may vary among provinces. OBJECTIVE To assess these potential differences according to province and time. METHODS Provincial antimicrobial prescribing data at the individual drug level were acquired from the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance for 2000 to 2010. Data were used to calculate two yearly metrics: prescriptions per 1000 inhabitant-days and the average defined daily doses per prescription. The proportion of liquid oral prescriptions of total prescriptions was also calculated as a proxy measure for the proportion of prescriptions given to children versus adults. To assess the significance of provincial antimicrobial use, linear mixed models were developed for each metric, accounting for repeated measurements over time. RESULTS Significant differences among provinces were found, as well as significant changes in use over time. Newfoundland and Labrador was found to have significantly higher prescribing rates than all other provinces (P{\textless}0.001) in 2010, as well as the mean of all other provinces (P{\textless}0.001). In contrast, Quebec exhibited significantly lower prescribing than all other provinces (P{\textless}0.001 for all provinces except British Columbia, where P=0.024) and the mean of all other provinces (P{\textless}0.001). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION Reports of reductions in antimicrobial use at the Canadian level are promising, especially prescribing to children; however, care must be taken to avoid the pitfall of the ecological fallacy. Reductions are not consistent among the provinces or among the classes of antimicrobial drugs dispensed in Canada.

abstract = {This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 2 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM). The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious disease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.},

abstract = {While pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have shown to be highly effective against invasive pneumococcal disease, their potential effectiveness against acute otitis media (AOM) might become a major economic driver for implementing these vaccines in national immunization programmes. However, the relationship between the costs and benefits of available vaccines remains a controversial topic. Our objective is to systematically review the literature on the cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against AOM in children. We searched PubMed, Cochrane and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE], NHS Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED] and Health Technology Assessment database [HTA]) from inception until 18 February 2010. We used the following keywords with their synonyms: 'otitis media', 'children', 'cost-effectiveness', 'costs' and 'vaccine'. Costs per AOM episode averted were calculated based on the information in this literature. A total of 21 studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were included. The quality of the included studies was moderate to good. The cost per AOM episode averted varied from {\&}U20AC;168 to {\&}U20AC;4214, and assumed incidence rates varied from 20,952 to 118,000 per 100,000 children aged 0-10 years. Assumptions regarding direct and indirect costs varied between studies. The assumed vaccine efficacy of the 7-valent pneumococcal CRM197-conjugate vaccine was mainly adopted from two trials, which reported 6-8{\%} efficacy. However, some studies assumed additional effects such as herd immunity or only took into account AOM episodes caused by serotypes included in the vaccine, which resulted in efficacy rates varying from 12{\%} to 57{\%}. Costs per AOM episode averted were inversely related to the assumed incidence rates of AOM and to the estimated costs per AOM episode. The median costs per AOM episode averted tended to be lower in industry-sponsored studies. Key assumptions regarding the incidence and costs of AOM episodes have major implications for the estimated cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against AOM. Uniform methods for estimating direct and indirect costs of AOM should be agreed upon to reliably compare the cost effectiveness of available and future pneumococcal vaccines against AOM.},

abstract = {The burden of respiratory infections is mainly seen in primary healthcare. To evaluate the potential impact of new preventive strategies against respiratory infections, such as the implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for infants in 2006 in The Netherlands, we conducted a baseline retrospective cohort study of electronic primary-care patient records to assess consultation rates, comorbidities and antibiotic prescription rates for respiratory infections in primary care. We found that between 1995 and 2005, overall registered consultation rates for lower respiratory tract infections had increased by 42{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}, upper respiratory infections declined by 4{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}, and otitis media remained unchanged. Concomitantly, there was a steady rise in overall comorbidity (75{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}) and antibiotic prescription rates (67{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}). Since Dutch primary-care rates for respiratory infections changed considerably between 1995 and 2005, these changes must be taken into account to properly evaluate the effect of population-based preventive strategies on primary-care utilization.},

abstract = {Data collected from 1980 to 1989 by investigators at the Pittsburgh Otitis Media Research Center were examined to detect changes over time in the prevalence of bacteria isolated from middle ear effusions in patients with otitis media. The organisms isolated most commonly from the 7396 effusions cultured at the center were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. S. pneumoniae predominated in the subgroup of patients with acute otitis media, whereas H. influenzae was isolated most frequently from patients with otitis media with effusion. The most notable changes to occur during the 10-year period were a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of S. pneumoniae in patients with acute otitis media and a progressive rise in the percentage of beta-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The latter finding suggests the need for therapeutic alternatives to amoxicillin, which is not active against beta-lactamase-producing organisms, when these organisms are suspected or cultured from the middle ear.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the province of Quebec, Canada, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is offered to all children aged less than 5 years, and a 2+1 schedule (2, 4, and 12 months) is recommended for low-risk infants, with other schedules including a lower number of doses for older children. OBJECTIVE: To estimate PCV effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). METHODS: IPD cases in children aged 2-59 months and reported during the years 2005-2007 were eligible and uninfected controls were randomly identified in the provincial health insurance registry. Parents were interviewed by telephone and immunization records were reviewed. The PCV effectiveness was computed using unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: 180 IPD cases (60.4{\%} of total reported) and 897 controls were included. Predictors of IPD risk were age, season, high-risk medical conditions, day-care attendance, and low family income. Overall PCV protection ({\textgreater} or =1 dose) against IPD caused by any serotype was 60{\%} (95{\%} CI: 38{\%}-75{\%}), and was 92{\%} (83{\%}-96{\%}) against IPD caused by vaccine serotypes. Among low-risk children who received the recommended 2+1 schedule, 6 cases of vaccine failure occurred after the first dose, 1 case after the second dose, and no cases after the booster dose. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the effectiveness of PCV after 2 and 3 doses.},

The pre- and post-vaccine introduction periods spanned 1997-2000 and 2001-2010, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 513 children with IPD, 36 were 1 to 90 days and accounted for 7{\%} of IPD cases in both the pre- and post-vaccine introduction period. The pre-vaccine IPD incidence rate was 5.0 per 100 000 live births, and was unchanged in the post-vaccine introduction period. IPD caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased by 74{\%} (from 2.2 to 0.58 per 100 000), whereas non-vaccine serotype IPD increased by 57{\%} (from 2.8 to 4.4 per 100 000). Sixteen infants (44{\%}) required intensive care, and 3 (8{\%}) died. Bacteremia without focus (56{\%}) and meningitis (44{\%}) were the predominant syndromes in the pre- and post-vaccine introduction periods, respectively. In the post-vaccine introduction period, serotype 7F was the most common serotype among infants and was responsible for 50{\%} of meningitis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IPD in Utah infants aged 1 to 90 days caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased after PCV7 introduction, but overall incidence was unchanged.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2000, a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed for use among US children. Many sites have since reported changes in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We recognized an opportunity to describe the changes in epidemiology, clinical syndromes, and serotype distribution during a 14-year period including 4 years before vaccine introduction and spanning the entire PCV7 era.

METHODS: Cases were defined as children {\textless}18 years of age who were cared for at Primary Children's Medical Center for culture-confirmed IPD. We defined the prevaccine period as the time frame spanning from 1997 to 2000 and the postvaccine period from 2001 to 2010. Demographics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected through electronic query and chart review. Streptococcus pneumoniae serotyping was performed using the capsular swelling method.

RESULTS: The median age of children with IPD increased from 19 months during the prevaccine period to 27 months during postvaccine period (P = 0.02), with a larger proportion of IPD among children older than 5 years. The proportion of IPD associated with pneumonia increased substantially from 29{\%} to 50{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in complicated pneumonia (17{\%} to 33{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Nonvaccine serotypes 7F, 19A, 22F, and 3 emerged as the dominant serotypes in the postvaccine period. In children with IPD who were younger than 5 years, for whom vaccine is recommended, 67{\%} of the cases were caused by serotypes in 13-valent PCV during 2005 to 2010.

CONCLUSIONS: After PCV7 was introduced, significant changes in IPD were noted. One-third of IPD occurred in children older than 5 years, who were outside the age-group for which PCV is recommended. Continued surveillance is warranted to identify further evolution of the epidemiology, clinical syndromes, and serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae after 13-valent PCV licensure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media non-responsive to antibiotics is most commonly caused by antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. A strategy for treating these infections with parenteral ceftriaxone was adopted at The Children's Hospital Iceland. The 10-valent pneumococcal H. influenzae Protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) was introduced into the vaccination program in Iceland in 2011. The aim was to study its effect on the incidence of AOM with treatment failure. METHODS This retrospective observational study included children who visited The Children's Hospital Iceland because of AOM or received ceftriaxone regardless of indication from 2008-2015. Incidence rate was calculated for pre-vaccine (2008-2011) and post-vaccine (2012-2015) periods using person-years at risk within the hospital's referral region. Incidence rate ratio of ceftriaxone treatment episodes of AOM were calculated using the Mantel-Haenzel method adjusting for age. Incidence risk ratio of ceftriaxone treatment if presenting to the hospital with AOM was calculated to adjust for rate of AOM visits. RESULTS Visits for AOM decreased from 47.5 to 33.9 visits per 1000 person-years, IRR 0.86 (95{\%}CI 0.81-0.91), P{\textless}.001. Fewer AOM episodes were treated with ceftriaxone, decreasing from 6.49 to 2.96 treatment episodes per 1000 person-years, with an overall Mantel-Haenzel adjusted IRR 0.45 (95{\%}CI 0.37-0.54), P{\textless}.001. This remained significant after adjusting for the decrease in AOM visits, IRR 0.53 (95{\%}CI 0.44-0.63), P{\textless}.001. CONCLUSIONS Visits for AOM and ceftriaxone use decreased significantly following PHiD-CV10 introduction. The observed decrease in ceftriaxone use is presumed to represent a decline in AOM with treatment failure, secondary to a decrease in resistant infections.},

abstract = {Background: Coinfection with respiratory virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae has been frequently reported in several epidemiologic studies. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of preceding human metapneumovirus (hMPV) inoculation on subsequent pneumococcal infection. Methods: Hep-2 and A549 cells were infected with hMPV then inoculated with S. pneumoniae. Bacterial adhesion was measured using colony forming unit and cytometric-fluorescence assays. In vivo bacterial adhesion was examined in hMPV-infected mice after inoculation of fluorescence-conjugated S. pneumoniae. Pulmonary inflammation (bacterial titers, cytokine levels, and histopathology) of hMPV-infected mice was investigated after inoculation with S. pneumoniae. Results: In vitro results of bacterial infection with S. pneumoniae on A549 and Hep-2 monolayer cells showed that even though cellular adherence was variable among different serotypes, there was significantly enhanced bacterial adherence in A549 cells with preceding hMPV infection. In addition, in vivo study of hMPV-infected mice showed increased adhesion of S. pneumoniae on the bronchial epithelium with delayed bacterial clearance and exacerbated histopathology. Furthermore, mice with preceding hMPV infection showed repressed recruitment of airway neutrophils with decreased expression of neutrophil chemoattractants during pneumococcal infection. Conclusion: These results suggest that hMPV-infected airway cells, especially the lower airway epithelium, express increased adherence with S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, hMPV-infected mice showed impaired recruitment of airway neutrophils, possibly leading to delayed bacterial clearance and exacerbated pulmonary inflammation, after secondary infection with pneumococcal isolates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Antibiotic consumption in the primary care sector is often perceived as synonymous with consumption in general practice despite the fact that few countries stratify the primary care sector by providers' medical specialty. We aimed to characterize and quantify antibiotic use in Danish general practice relative to the entire primary care sector. METHODS This was a registry-based study including all patients who redeemed an antibiotic prescription between July 2004 and June 2013 at a Danish community pharmacy. Antibiotic use was expressed as DDDs and treatments/1000 inhabitants/day (DIDs and TIDs, respectively) and assessed according to antibiotic spectrum (narrow versus broad) and their anatomical therapeutic classification codes in total as well as in six age groups. RESULTS The contribution of general practice to the entire antibiotic use in the primary care sector declined during the study period (TIDs, 79{\%}-75{\%}; DIDs, 77{\%}-73{\%}). Antibiotic use in general practice increased 8{\%} when expressed as DIDs, while a 9{\%} decrease was observed when expressed as TIDs. The use of broad-spectrum agents increased while narrow-spectrum agents decreased. The decline in antibiotic use was most prominent in children aged {\textless}5 years, while elderly patients were increasingly prescribed antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Using the entire primary care sector as a proxy for general practice prescribing is imprecise. Antibiotic use in general practice is at a stable high level, but DID and TID analyses show different trends and both should be applied when detailing changes in antibiotic consumption. While children are prescribed fewer narrow-spectrum agents, the observed increase in the use of broad-spectrum agents is worrisome and should be addressed in future interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Treatment of otitis media in children is associated with substantial expenditures because of its high frequency during childhood. Vaccines against respiratory pathogens causing otitis media are now being developed. Information about otitis media-related medical expenditures will be needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of these preventive interventions. METHODS This study used utilization data from claims to impute otitis media-related expenditures for medical visits, pharmaceuticals, and surgical procedures for 87 057 children 13 years of age and younger who were continuously enrolled in Colorado's fee-for-service Medicaid program during 1992. International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes were used to identify visits for otitis media. An antibiotic was considered to have been prescribed to treat otitis media if it was dispensed up to 24 hours before or within 48 hours after a physician encounter showing a diagnosis of otitis media. All tympanostomies, mastoidectomies, and adenoidectomies were assumed to be related to otitis media. Expenditures were imputed from utilization using a Medicaid fee schedule. National expenditures for 1992 to treat otitis media were extrapolated from Colorado's Medicaid data. We adjusted for differences between Colorado and the United States as a whole in terms of price, number, and intensity of services; for differences in reimbursement rates by service between Medicaid and private insurance; and for differences in utilization between Medicaid enrollees and the uninsured. To provide a more current expression of medical expenditures for otitis media, we inflated the 1992 expenditure estimates to 1998 dollars using the Consumer Price Index published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. RESULTS Twenty-eight percent of children experienced at least 1 episode of diagnosed otitis media. The proportion of children with a diagnosis of otitis media was highest (42{\%}-60{\%}) in the 7-month to 36-month age range. The proportion was also higher among white (34.5{\%}) and Hispanic (25.3{\%}) children than among black children (18.5{\%}), as well as among rural (34.5{\%}) compared with urban children (27.2{\%}). Children 19 to 24 months of age incurred the highest total annual expenditures per child with otitis media ({\$}239.68). Expenditures for drugs, visits, and procedures were all highest for this group. The per-patient cost to Medicaid was greater for visits than for drugs or procedures across all age groups. Total per-patient expenditures were higher for males ({\$}174.67) than for females ({\$}154.47) and higher for white children ({\$}176.59) than for Hispanic ({\$}154.12) or black children ({\$}134.44). The differences among the ethnic groups can be attributed almost entirely to differences in expenditures for procedures and drugs. Although mean expenditures per patient varied substantially by some patient characteristics (eg, race), these differences accounted for only a small fraction of the enormous variation in costs per patient. Including children with and without otitis media, age-specific estimated expenditures per child peaked among children 1 ({\$}132.94) and 2 years of age ({\$}88.72). Children 3 to 6 years of age incurred expenditures only one third as great as those incurred by children 1 year of age. Total national expenditures were estimated to have been approximately {\$}4.1 billion in 1992 dollars and {\$}5.3 billion in 1998 dollars. Over 40{\%} of national expenditures to treat otitis media in children younger than 14 years of age were incurred for children between 1 and 3 years of age ({\$}453 per capita in 1992 dollars over these 2 years vs {\$}1027 for all years of age from 2 to 13). Nationally, expenditures for visits remained the largest component of expenditures.

abstract = {Reduction of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) has recently become a reality. We now know that (1) most clinically significant DRSP strains belong to seven serotypes (6A, 6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F, 23F), (2) five (6B, 9V, 14, 19F, 23F) of the seven are constituents of heptavalent PCV (PCV7), and (3) the remaining two serotypes (6A, 19A) are immunologically related to serotypes in PCV7, but only 6A has been reduced by PCV7. Furthermore, PCVs can also reduce DRSP in unvaccinated individuals (herd immunity). PCVs lead to a reduction in antibiotic use, which is also potentially helpful to contain DRSP. Although a reduction in disease caused by most penicillin-resistant strains has been reported, reductions in intermediately penicillin-resistant strains has not been shown to the same degree, because of increased intermediate resistance among non-PCV7 serotypes. Serotype 19A, which is both antibiotic resistant and a common cause of disease, is not affected by PCV7, and is now increasing worldwide, including in countries without PCV7. Continued exposure of non-PCV7 serotypes to antibiotic pressure may reduce the overall impact of PCVs on DRSP. Further strategies include expansion of PCV serotype coverage, development of protein-based vaccines, and further limitation of antibiotic use.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND At Driscoll Children's Hospital (Corpus Christi, Tex), we observed that most infants and children hospitalized for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics despite having typical RSV signs and symptoms and positive RSV-rapid-antigen tests on admission. Physicians were concerned about the possibility of concurrent serious bacterial infections, especially in infants younger than 3 months and in those with infiltrates present on the chest x-ray films. OBJECTIVE To report the frequency of concurrent serious bacterial infections in infants and children hospitalized for treatment of RSV lower respiratory tract infections. METHODS The medical records of 2396 infants and children admitted to Driscoll Children's Hospital with RSV bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia during 7 RSV seasons from July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1998, were reviewed. RESULTS There were positive cultures obtained from initial sepsis/meningitis workups on admission in 39 infants and children (1.6{\%}). Of these, 12 (31{\%}) were positive blood cultures and 27 (69{\%}) were positive urine cultures. There were no positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures. All of the positive blood cultures contained either Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus warneri, or Bacillus species, which are common contaminants. None of the patients received a standard 10-day course of intravenous antibiotic therapy. All of the positive urine cultures were typical urinary tract pathogens. All of the patients were treated. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent serious bacterial infections are rare in infants and children hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infections and the empiric use of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is unnecessary in children with typical signs and symptoms of RSV bronchiolitis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 800,000 children die each year due to pneumococcal disease and {\textgreater}90{\%} of these deaths occur in developing countries where few children have access to life-saving serotype-based vaccines. Understanding the serotype epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among children is necessary for vaccine development and introduction policies. The aim of this study was to systematically estimate the global and regional distributions of serotypes causing IPD in children {\textless}5 years of age.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We systematically reviewed studies with IPD serotype data among children {\textless}5 years of age from the published literature and unpublished data provided by researchers. Studies conducted prior to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction, from 1980 to 2007, with ≥12 months of surveillance, and reporting ≥20 serotyped isolates were included. Serotype-specific proportions were pooled in a random effects meta-analysis and combined with PD incidence and mortality estimates to infer global and regional serotype-specific PD burden. Of 1,292, studies reviewed, 169 were included comprising 60,090 isolates from 70 countries. Globally and regionally, six to 11 serotypes accounted for ≥70{\%} of IPD. Seven serotypes (1, 5, 6A, 6B, 14, 19F, 23F) were the most common globally; and based on year 2000 incidence and mortality estimates these seven serotypes accounted for {\textgreater}300,000 deaths in Africa and 200,000 deaths in Asia. Serotypes included in both the 10- and 13-valent PCVs accounted for 10 million cases and 600,000 deaths worldwide.

CONCLUSIONS: A limited number of serotypes cause most IPD worldwide. The serotypes included in existing PCV formulations account for 49{\%}-88{\%} of deaths in Africa and Asia where PD morbidity and mortality are the highest, but few children have access to these life-saving vaccines.

We compared the accuracy of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the CURB-65 and CRB-65 score, the modified-American Thoracic Society score (ATS), the IDSA/ATS guidelines and the Pitt Bacteraemia score (PBS) in evaluating severity of illness in 766 patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity, the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) and the accuracy of the classification in predicting 14-day mortality. The PSI and the IDSA/ATS guidelines were the most sensitive whereas the PBS and modified-ATS scoring systems were the most specific in predicting mortality. The NPV was comparable for all four scoring systems (all above 90{\%}), but the PPV was highest for PBS (54.2{\%}) and lowest for PSI (23.2{\%}). The predictive accuracy and discriminating power as measured by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was highest for the PBS. Both the modified-ATS and the PBS scoring systems identified those patients who might benefit most from intensified care and monitoring. The PBS and modified-ATS proved superior to the IDSA/ATS guidelines, CURB-65 and CRB-65 with respect to their specificity and PPV.

This article provides an overview of the well-established immunogenicity of PHiD-CV, including functional immune responses and immunologic memory, as well as immune responses in preterm infants and HIV-infected children. It also includes a brief discussion of cross-protection against vaccine-related serotypes (6A and 19A) and focuses on labelling in the EU, where PHiD-CV is approved for active immunization against invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) caused by S. pneumoniae in infants and young children up to 5 years of age. Evidence of the protective efficacy and effectiveness of PHiD-CV against pneumococcal diseases is available from several studies, including the randomized, double-blind trials COMPAS (Clinical Otitis Media and Pneumonia Study) and FinIP (Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease), as well as postmarketing studies from various countries. As would be expected, protection against pneumonia or AOM is substantially lower than that against invasive pneumococcal disease, as many micro-organisms other than pneumococcal vaccine serotypes can cause pneumonia and AOM, thereby limiting the overall protection of PHiD-CV against these diseases. PHiD-CV has a safety and reactogenicity profile similar to that of other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.},

This study examined the factors that predict which children are most likely to receive tympanostomy tubes through 3 years of age. METHODS Multiple logistic regression was conducted on data from a nationally representative sample of children (N = 8285). RESULTS By 3 years of age, 6.8{\%} of US children had tubes inserted. Logistic regression indicated that after control for number of ear infections, children without any gaps in health insurance, who attended a day-care center, who were White, whose birth-weight was less than 1500 g, and who lived in the Midwest or South were significantly more likely to have tympanostomy tubes. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that differences exist as to who receives tubes. Of particular concern are differences by race/ethnicity and continuity of health insurance coverage. With expansions in health care coverage to larger proportions of uninsured children, it will be important to monitor these programs to ensure that all children who may need tympanostomy tubes have access to them.},

@article{Weinberger2011,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Before the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar-7), the relative prevalence of serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae was fairly stable worldwide. We sought to develop a statistical tool to predict the relative frequency of different serotypes among disease isolates in the pre- and post-Prevnar-7 eras using the limited amount of data that is widely available.

METHODS: We initially used pre-Prevnar-7 carriage prevalence and estimates of invasiveness derived from case-fatality data as predictors for the relative abundance of serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease during the pre- and post-Prevnar-7 eras, using negative binomial regression. We fit the model to pre-Prevnar-7 invasive pneumococcal disease data from England and Wales and used these data to (1) evaluate the performance of the model using several datasets and (2) evaluate the utility of the country-specific carriage data. We then fit an alternative model that used polysaccharide structure, a correlate of prevalence that does not require country-specific information and could be useful in determining the postvaccine population structure, as a predictor.

RESULTS: Predictions from the initial model fit data from several pediatric populations in the pre-Prevnar-7 era. After the introduction of Prevnar-7, the model still had a good negative predictive value, though substantial unexplained variation remained. The alternative model had a good negative predictive value but poor positive predictive value. Both models demonstrate that the pneumococcal population follows a somewhat predictable pattern even after vaccination.

CONCLUSIONS: This approach provides a preliminary framework to evaluate the potential patterns and impact of serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease.},

@article{Ben-Shimol2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCVs) impact on complex otitis media (OM; including recurrent, nonresponsive, and chronic OM with effusion) was greater than that on simple, acute OM in previous studies. Since complex OM is often a polymicrobial disease, we speculated that reduction of complex OM by PCVs would be associated with reduction of non-pneumococcal OM. METHODS In a prospective, population-based, active surveillance, all OM episodes submitted for middle ear fluid culture in children {\textless}3 years from 2004 through 2015 were included. Three sub-periods were established: pre-PCV, PCV7, and PCV13. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing the 3 periods were calculated for pneumococcal, nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and culture-negative OM. RESULTS Overall, 7475 episodes were included. Of all-NTHi cases in the pre-PCV period, 34{\%} were mixed with Streptococcus pneumoniae IRRs (95{\%} confidence interval) comparing the pre-PCV to the PCV13 period were 0.02 (0.01-0.04), 0.12 (0.08-0.20), and 0.18 (0.15-0.21) for PCV7+6A serotypes, 5 additional PCV13 serotypes, and all-pneumococcal OM, respectively; non-PCV13 serotype episodes were not significantly reduced. IRRs for single NTHi, mixed NTHi + S. pneumoniae, and all-NTHi OM were 0.30 (0.25-0.35), 0.18 (0.13-0.24), and 0.25 (0.22-0.29), respectively. Moraxella catarrhalis, S. pyogenes, and culture-negative episodes were also significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS Both pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal OM episodes, enriched with complex cases, declined substantially in children {\textless}3 years following sequential PCV7/PCV13 introduction. The reduction in non-pneumococcal episodes may be attributed to early OM episodes prevention, resulting in a lower rate of complex, often non-pneumococcal OM.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To compare tympanostomy tube insertion for children with otitis media in 2002 with the recommendations of two sets of expert guidelines. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING New York metropolitan area practices associated with five diverse hospitals. PARTICIPANTS 682 of 1046 children who received tympanostomy tubes in the five hospitals for whom charts from the hospital, primary care physician, and otolaryngologist could be accessed. RESULTS The mean age was 3.8 years. On average, children with acute otitis media had fewer than four infections in the year before surgery. Children with otitis media with effusion had less than 30 consecutive days of effusion at the time of surgery. Concordance with recommendations was very low: 30.3{\%} (n=207) of all tympanostomies were concordant with the explicit criteria developed for this study and 7.5{\%} (n=13) with the 1994 guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Medicine, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Children who had previously had tympanostomy tube surgery, who were having a concomitant procedure, or who had "at risk conditions" were more likely to be discordant. CONCLUSIONS A significant majority of tympanostomy tube insertions in the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the United States were inappropriate according to the explicit criteria and not recommended according to both guidelines. Regardless of whether current practice represents a substantial overuse of surgery or the guidelines are overly restrictive, the persistent discrepancy between guidelines and practice cannot be good for children or for people interested in improving their health care.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Despite the transition to competency-based education in surgery, few standardized assessment tools exist in otolaryngology training. In particular, myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion (M+T) is a common surgical procedure with few validated assessment tools available. Our objectives were to develop an objective structured assessment of operative skills in M+T and to provide validity evidence for the developed assessment tool within otolaryngology training. STUDY DESIGN Prospective study involving the evaluation of an assessment tool. METHODS Through consultation with a panel of experts in otolaryngology and medical education we developed a Task-Specific Checklist and Global Rating Scale for M+T. Postgraduate year 2 junior residents, postgraduate year 3 senior residents, and attending otolaryngologists were video recorded performing M+T at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. The videos were subsequently reviewed and independently evaluated by three blinded raters from an unaffiliated academic institution. RESULTS The average score of junior residents, senior residents, and attending otolaryngologists using the Task-Specific Checklist was 21.7/30 (±7.1), 26.3/30 (±3.5), and 27.3/30 (±6.2), respectively (P = .04). For the Global Rating Scale, the scores for junior residents, senior residents, and attending surgeons were 27.7/50 (±11.2), 34.5/50 (±9.5), and 45.1/50 (±4.6), respectively (P {\textless} .001). The inter-rater and intrarater reliability were both above 0.88. CONCLUSIONS The Task-Specific Checklist and Global Rating Scale for M+T appear reliable, with validity evidence supporting their use in otolaryngology training.

@article{Barber2017,
abstract = {BACKGROUND National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. METHODS We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r=0{\textperiodcentered}88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0{\textperiodcentered}83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r=0{\textperiodcentered}77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time. FINDINGS Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28{\textperiodcentered}6 to 94{\textperiodcentered}6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40{\textperiodcentered}7 (95{\%} uncertainty interval, 39{\textperiodcentered}0-42{\textperiodcentered}8) in 1990 to 53{\textperiodcentered}7 (52{\textperiodcentered}2-55{\textperiodcentered}4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21{\textperiodcentered}2 in 1990 to 20{\textperiodcentered}1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73{\textperiodcentered}8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015. INTERPRETATION This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system characteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.

abstract = {IntroductionPneumonia is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 in Egypt, and the Ministry of Health of Egypt is considering introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in its national immunization program. We performed an economic analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this vaccine in Egypt and to provide the decision-makers with needed evidence. MethodsThe analysis was done using the TRIVAC model. Data included demographic characteristics, burden of disease, coverage and efficacy of the vaccine, health resource utilization, and costs of pneumococcal disease vaccination and treatment. Whenever possible, we used national or regional data. Two alternatives were compared: (1) general vaccination of children younger than 5 years with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), using a three-dose schedule without booster, and (2) no vaccination. Outcomes of 10 cohorts from birth to 5 years were analyzed. The study was performed from the governmental perspective and selected public health providers. ResultsIn comparison to no vaccine, the introduction of PCV13 would be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US{\$} 3916 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted (government perspective). The total incremental cost of the PCV vaccination program (10 cohorts) would be approximately US{\$} 1.09 billion. Over the 10 cohorts, the program would avert 8583 pneumococcal deaths - 42{\%} of all pneumococcal-related deaths. ConclusionThe introduction of PCV13 would be a good value for money from the government perspective. It would represent a high-impact public health intervention for Egypt and respond to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) resolution on reducing pneumonia burden and overall child mortality. Strengthening surveillance will be critical to generating high-quality national data, improving future economic analyses that support evidence-based decisions for introducing vaccines and public health interventions, and to monitoring their impact.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Numerous sequelae have been noted in survivors of bacterial meningitis; however, few studies document sequelae for several years following a childhood episode of bacterial meningitis. In addition, studies generally focus on the more commonly found sequelae. To review the known information and highlight this gap, this article presents a comprehensive literature review of the long-term (≥ 5 years of follow-up) sequelae of childhood bacterial meningitis. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted between December 2009 and February 2010. English-language articles published between January 1970 and January 2010 were selected for screening. Articles were included if the subjects were between the ages of 1 month and {\textless}18 years at the time of diagnoses of meningitis. RESULTS A total of 1433 children who were survivors of childhood bacterial meningitis were evaluated for sequelae after the time of discharge. Of these children, 705 (49.2{\%}) were reported to have 1 or more long-term sequelae. A majority of reported sequelae were behavioral and/or intellectual disorders (n 455, 45.0{\%}). Hearing changes accounted for 6.7{\%} (n 68) of sequelae and gross neurologic deficits accounted for 14.3{\%} (n 145). DISCUSSION A majority of childhood bacterial meningitis survivors with long-term sequelae that are documented in the literature have academic and behavioral limitations. While neurologic deficits may resolve over time, subtle behavioral deficits may not be appreciated initially and may continue to affect survivors for many years. Further studies are needed to quantify the true societal and economic burden of long-term sequelae as well as fully understand the breadth of types of sequelae that survivors experience.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: During the 1990s, antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) decreased in the United States. The sustainability of those changes is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in antibiotic prescriptions for ARTI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data (1995-2006) were used to examine trends in antibiotic prescription rates by antibiotic indication and class. Annual survey data and census denominators were combined in 2-year intervals for rate calculations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: National annual visit rates and antibiotic prescription rates for ARTI, including otitis media (OM) and non-ARTI. RESULTS: Among children younger than 5 years, annual ARTI visit rates decreased by 17{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 9{\%}-24{\%}), from 1883 per 1000 population in 1995-1996 to 1560 per 1000 population in 2005-2006, primarily due to a 33{\%} (95{\%} CI, 22{\%}-43{\%}) decrease in OM visit rates (950 to 634 per 1000 population, respectively). This decrease was accompanied by a 36{\%} (95{\%} CI, 26{\%}-45{\%}) decrease in ARTI-associated antibiotic prescriptions (1216 to 779 per 1000 population). Among persons aged 5 years or older, ARTI visit rates remained stable but associated antibiotic prescription rates decreased by 18{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6{\%}-29{\%}), from 178 to 146 per 1000 population. Antibiotic prescription rates for non-OM ARTI for which antibiotics are rarely indicated decreased by 41{\%} (95{\%} CI, 22{\%}-55{\%}) and 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 10{\%}-37{\%}) among persons younger than 5 years and 5 years or older, respectively. Overall, ARTI-associated prescription rates for penicillin, cephalosporin, and sulfonamide/tetracycline decreased. Prescription rates for azithromycin increased and it became the most commonly prescribed macrolide for ARTI and OM (10{\%} of OM visits). Among adults, quinolone prescriptions increased. CONCLUSIONS: Overall antibiotic prescription rates for ARTI decreased, associated with fewer OM visits in children younger than 5 years and with fewer prescriptions for ARTI for which antibiotics are rarely indicated. However, prescription rates for broad-spectrum antibiotics increased significantly.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to adapt to an individual physician level and to the paediatric context a set of drug-specific indicators of outpatient antibiotic use developed by the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) project, and to describe the differences in antibiotic prescriptions between general practitioners (GPs) and paediatricians. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study analysing antibiotic prescriptions in 2009 for children below 16 years of age in south-eastern France, using the National Health Insurance (NHI) outpatient reimbursement database. A generalised linear model adjusted on physicians' characteristics and patient population characteristics was used to compare indicators between GPs and paediatricians. We included 4,921 self-employed GPs and 301 paediatricians. Penicillins accounted for 47{\%} and 45{\%} of all antibiotics prescribed by GPs and paediatricians, respectively, followed by cephalosporins (33{\%} and 39{\%}) and macrolides (14{\%} and 9{\%}). In both specialties, there were around 70{\%} more antibiotic prescriptions during the winter quarters compared to the summer quarters. The 13 indicators we calculated showed wide variations in antibiotic prescriptions among GPs, among paediatricians, and between GPs and paediatricians. In an adjusted econometric model, GPs were found to issue 54{\%} more antibiotic prescriptions than paediatricians, whereas paediatricians used a significantly higher proportion of co-amoxiclav (18{\%} vs. 12{\%}) and cephalosporins (39{\%} vs. 33{\%}) and a significantly lower proportion of macrolides (9{\%} vs. 14{\%}) compared to GPs. A set of 13 indicators may be calculated using reimbursement data to describe outpatient antibiotic use at the physician level. We observed very different prescribing profiles between GPs and paediatricians.},

abstract = {Most household models of disease transmission assume static household distributions. Although this is a reasonable simplification for assessing vaccination strategies at a single point in time or over the course of an outbreak, it has considerable drawbacks for assessing long term vaccination policies or for predicting future changes in immunity. We demonstrate that household models that include births, deaths and movement between households can show dramatically different patterns of infection and immunity to static population models. When immunity is assumed to be life-long, the pattern of births by household size is the key driver of infection, suggesting that the influx of susceptibles has most impact on infection risk in the household. In a comparison of 12 countries, we show that both the crude birth rate and the mean household size affect the risk of infection in households. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is a common sequela in children with tympanostomy tubes. Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is generally a symptom of an acute middle ear infection, whereby middle ear fluid drains through the tube. The widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) has changed the bacterial prevalence in the upper respiratory tract of children, but its impact on bacterial and viral pathogens causing acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is yet unknown. METHODS This study was performed in the post-PCV7 era parallel to a randomized clinical trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ototopical and systemic antibiotics and initial observation in 230 children aged 1 to 10 years with untreated, uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Otorrhea and nasopharyngeal samples were collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 2 weeks (after treatment). Conventional bacterial culture was performed followed by antimicrobial-resistance assessment. Viruses were identified by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS At baseline, Haemophilus influenzae (41{\%}), Staphylococcus aureus (40{\%}) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18{\%}) were the most prevalent bacteria in otorrhea, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7{\%}) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4{\%}). Most pneumococci were non-PCV7 serotypes. Viruses were detected in 45 otorrhea samples at baseline (21{\%}). Most infections were polymicrobial and overall antimicrobial resistance was low. CONCLUSIONS H. influenzae, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are the most common microorganisms in children with untreated uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Prevalence of S. pneumoniae has decreased since the introduction of PCV and most pneumococci are nonvaccine serotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the developed societies, day-care centers (DCCs) play an important role in the spread of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci both within the facility and from the facility to the community. This study was conducted to determine the effect of a nonavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-9) on the carriage of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci in the DCC. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Healthy DCC attendees ages 12 to 35 months were randomized to receive either PCV-9 or a control vaccine (conjugate meningococcus C vaccine) in a double blinded manner. Nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae cultures were obtained from each subject before vaccination, monthly during the first year of follow-up and every 2 to 3 months during the second year of follow-up. For each isolate the serotype and antibiotic susceptibility were determined. RESULTS: A total of 132 and 130 evaluable toddlers received either PCV-9 or the control vaccine, respectively. In total 3748 cultures were obtained, of which 2450 (65{\%}) were positive for S. pneumoniae. The resistance rates to penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin were 36, 35 and 16{\%}, respectively. Resistance rates to {\textgreater} or =1 and {\textgreater} or =3 antibiotic categories were 52 and 9{\%}, respectively. Antibiotic resistance was found mainly in the 5 serotypes included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (6B, 9V, 14, 19F and 23F) and in 2 related serotypes (6A and 19A). In the vaccinated group a clear and significant reduction of the carriage rate of the serotypes included in the vaccine and the related serotype 6A as well as an increase in the carriage rate of the serotypes not included in the vaccine were observed. In parallel a significant decrease in carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci was observed. The reduction of carriage of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci was seen in all age windows but was greater in the age window {\textless}36 months. CONCLUSIONS: The carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae, including multiply resistant S. pneumoniae, in DCC attendees is high. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines seem to be an important tool for reducing the carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant pneumonia in DCCs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical and economic burden associated with invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) diseases is substantial in the Latin America and Caribbean region, where pneumococcal vaccines have only been introduced to a few countries. This study analyzed the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of three different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) for Peru.

METHODS: A Markov model that simulated the disease processes in a birth cohort over a lifetime, within 1,128 month cycles was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal NTHi protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and 7- and 13-valent PCVs (PCV-7 and PCV-13). Expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost-savings and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated.

RESULTS: Without vaccination, pneumonia was associated with the greatest health economic burden (90{\%} of QALYs lost and 63{\%} of lifetime direct medical costs); while acute otitis media (AOM) was responsible for 1{\%} of QALYs lost and 25{\%} of direct medical costs. All vaccines were predicted to be cost-effective for Peru, with PHiD-CV being most cost-effective. PHiD-CV was predicted to generate 50 more QALYs gained and required a reduced investment (-US{\$} 3.4 million) versus PCV-13 (discounted data), and was therefore dominant and cost saving. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that PHiD-CV generated more QALYs gained at a reduced cost than PCV-13 in 84{\%} of the simulations and less QALYs gains at a reduced cost in 16{\%}. Additional scenarios using different assumptions on vaccine efficacies based on previous evidence were explored, but no significant change in the overall cost-effective results were observed.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this modeling study predict that PCVs are likely to be a cost-effective strategy to help relieve the epidemiological and economic burden associated with pediatric pneumococcal and NTHi diseases for Peru. PHiD-CV is likely to be a dominant (better health gains at a reduced net cost) intervention compared to PCV-13 or PCV-7. The most significant drivers for these results are the better health and economic profile of PHiD-CV against AOM and its reduced cost per dose available through the PAHO Revolving Fund in the LAC region.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is a grave disease of high incidence, especially in less developed countries. Here, we describe its clinical presentation, spectrum of complications, prognostic factors, and outcome in adults with pneumococcal meningitis. METHODS: From October, 1998, to April, 2002, we assessed 352 episodes of community-acquired pneumococcal meningitis, confirmed by culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which occurred in patients older than 16 years. Predictors for an unfavourable outcome (Glasgow outcome scale score 1-4) were identified by logistic regression with multiple imputation techniques. FINDINGS: 245 (70{\%}) episodes of pneumococcal meningitis were associated with an underlying disorder. Cranial CT was done for 85{\%} of episodes and revealed underlying disorders in 17{\%} (50/299) and meningitis-associated intracranial complications in 39{\%} (117/299). Independent predictors for an unfavourable outcome were a low score on the Glasgow coma scale, cranial nerve palsies, a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a CSF leucocyte count less than 1000 cells per mm(3), and a high CSF protein concentration on admission. Overall in-hospital mortality was 30{\%}. Prevalence of neurological and systemic complications did not differ between patients aged younger than 60 years and those aged 60 years and older; however, systemic complications were the cause of death in 59{\%} (32/54) of fatal episodes in patients aged 60 years and older, whereas neurological complications were the cause of death in 65{\%} (20/31) of fatal episodes in younger patients. INTERPRETATION: Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates in adults. Whereas neurological complications are the leading cause of death in younger patients, elderly patients die predominantly from systemic complications.},

abstract = {Objective: To prospectively identify the bacterial aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of problematic (recurrent and treatment failure) acute otitis media in Spanish children several years after the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Methods: Tympanocentesis or careful sampling of spontaneous otorrhoea was performed on children aged 3 to {\textless}36 months with recurrent acute otitis media, acute otitis media treatment failure or unresolved acute otitis media. Results: 105 acute otitis media episodes (77 sampled by tympanocentesis, 28 otorrhoea samples) were evaluated: 46 recurrent, 35 treatment failures, 24 unresolved acute otitis media. 74 episodes (70.4{\%}) had at least one bacterium identified on culture: Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 21 episodes, Haemophilus influenzae (all non-typeable) in 44, Streptococcus pyogenes in 2, Moraxella catarrhalis in 2. No statistically significant difference in bacterial aetiology by episode type was detected. Non-typeable H. influenzae was the most commonly isolated pathogen in all acute otitis media types and in all age sub-groups. Forty percent of S. pneumoniae isolates were multi-drug resistant. Pneumococcal serotype 19A was the most frequently identified serotype (7/21 episodes). Multi-drug resistance was found in 56{\%} of 19A isolates. Of non-typeable H. influenzae isolates, 15{\%} were ampicillin resistant and 13{\%} were amoxicillin/clavulanate resistant. S. pneumoniae and non-typeable H. influenzae DNA were each detected in 57{\%} of samples culture negative for these pathogens, including 12 co-infections. Conclusion: Combining culture and polymerase chain reaction results, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae may be implicated in 70{\%} and 43{\%} of clinically problematic bacterial acute otitis media episodes, respectively. The impact of new vaccines to prevent both S. pneumoniae and non-typeable H. influenzae acute otitis media may be substantial in this population and is worth investigating. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

To understand recent trends, we evaluated AI/AN OM rates before and after 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction. METHODS We analyzed outpatient visits listing OM as a diagnosis among AI/AN children {\textless}5 years of age from the Indian Health Service National Patient Information Reporting System for 2010-2013. OM outpatient visits for the general US child population {\textless} 5 years of age were analyzed using the National Ambulatory Medical Care and National Hospital Ambulatory Care Surveys for 2010-2011. RESULTS The 2010-2011 OM-associated outpatient visit rate for AI/AN children (63.5 per 100/year) was similar to 2010-2011 rate for same-aged children in the general US population (62.8), and decreased from the 2003-2005 AI/AN rate (91.4). Further decline in AI/AN OM visit rates were seen for 2010-2011 to 2012-2013 (p-value{\textless}0.0001). The AI/AN infant OM visit rate (130.5) was 1.6 fold higher than the US infant population. For 2010-2011, the highest AI/AN OM visit rate for {\textless}5 year olds was from Alaska (135.0). CONCLUSION AI/AN {\textless} 5 year old OM visits declined by one-third from 2003-2005 to 2010-2011 to a rate similar to the US general population {\textless}5 years. However, the AI/AN infant OM rate remained higher than the US infant population. The highest AI/AN {\textless} 5 year old OM rate occurred in Alaska.},

The average annual rate for tympanostomy tube insertion among AI/AN children {\textless}5 years was 0.33 per 100.
The tympanos- tomy tube rate was over 10-fold higher in the Alaska region (2.43 per 100 per year) than for other IHS region [Southern Plains (0.18); P {\textless} 0.0001, Southwest (0.08; P {\textless} 0.0001)].
The Alaska region AI/AN tym- panostomy tube insertion rate was higher among males (2.89) than females (1.95; P {\textless} 0.0001). The
Tympanostomy tube insertions among children {\textless}5 years old were 2-fold higher for the Alaska IHS region, compared with the US rates, and 10-fold higher than other IHS regions.
Over 80{\%} of reported AI/AN tympanostomy tube insertions
were in the Alaska region. The Alaska AI/AN tympanostomy tube insertion rate (2.43 per 100/year) is twice as high as the US rate (0.98) for children {\textless}5 years, which reflects the 2-fold higher OM visit rate in Alaska AI/AN children. Outside},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Simultaneous carriage of more than one strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae promotes horizontal gene transfer events and may lead to capsule switch and acquisition of antibiotic resistance. We studied the epidemiology of cocolonization with S. pneumoniae before and after introduction of the seven-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). METHODOLOGY: Nasopharyngeal swabs (n 1120) were collected from outpatients between 2004 and 2009 within an ongoing nationwide surveillance program. Cocolonization was detected directly from swabs by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Serotypes were identified by agglutination, multiplex PCR and microarray. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rate of multiple colonization remained stable up to three years after PCV7 introduction. Cocolonization was associated with serotypes of low carriage prevalence in the prevaccine era. Pneumococcal colonization density was higher in cocolonized samples and cocolonizing strains were present in a balanced ratio (median 1.38). Other characteristics of cocolonization were a higher frequency at young age, but no association with recurrent acute otitis media, recent antibiotic exposure, day care usage and PCV7 vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal cocolonization is dominated by serotypes of low carriage prevalence in the prevaccine era, which coexist in the nasopharynx. Emergence of such previously rare serotypes under vaccine selection pressure may promote cocolonization in the future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There are limited data about the longer-term outcomes in acute otitis media (AOM) when comparing the realistic alternatives of immediate prescription of antibiotics and a 'wait and see' or delayed prescribing policy. AIM The aim was to assess the medium and longer term outcomes of two prescribing strategies for otitis media. DESIGN OF STUDY Follow-up of a randomised controlled trial cohort. SETTING Primary care. METHOD Three-hundred and fifteen children aged 6 months to 10 years presenting with AOM were randomised to immediate antibiotics, or antibiotics delayed at the parents discretion 72 hours if the child still had significant otalgia or fever, or was not improving. Episodes of earache since study entry were documented, and a poor score (of 9 or more--the top 20{\%}) on a reliable six-item functional rating scale (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75). RESULTS The delayed prescribing strategy did not significantly increase reported episodes of earache in the 3 months since randomisation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.48 to 1.65) or over 1 year (OR = 1.03; 95{\%} CI = 0.60 to 1.78) nor of poor scores on the function scale at 3 months (OR = 1.16; 95{\%} CI = 0.61 to 2.22) or 1 year (OR = 1.12; 95{\%} CI = 0.57 to 2.19), and controlling for subsequent antibiotic use after the randomised episode did not alter these estimates. The number of prior episodes of AOM documented in the doctor's notes predicted episodes of earache reported (0, 1, {\textgreater} or = 2 episodes, respectively; OR = 1, 2.42, 2.61; chi2 for trend 8.04; P{\textless}0.01). There was weaker evidence that prior episodes also predicted poor function at 1 year (OR = 1, 1.86, 2.28; chi2 for trend 5.49; P = 0.019). For children with recurrent AOM (two or more previous episodes documented in the doctor's notes, n = 43) there was possible evidence of fewer episodes of earache in the 3 months since study entry in the immediate antibiotic group (10{\%} compared to 39{\%} in the delayed group, chi2 4.8, P = 0.029), but no effect from randomisation to 1 year. CONCLUSIONS For most children, delayed prescribing is not likely to have adverse longer-term consequences. Children with recurrent AOM are more likely to have poorer outcomes.

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is part of the normal bacterial flora of the narsopharynx, but is also associated with several invasive and non-invasive diseases. Recently, there has been a plethora of research information on the pneumococcus, however, there are few comprehensive review papers discussing the research information. This paper provides a review of the pneumococcus in two vital areas related to its biology including transmission and evolution. Transmission of the pneumococcus is a highly efficient process that usually occurs through respiratory droplets from asymptomatic carriers. Following acquisition, the pneumococcus may only establish in the nasopharynx of the new host, or further progress to sites such as the lungs and cause disease. Pneumococcus transmission risk factors, as well as factors involved in its translocation from the nasophyarnx to diseases sites are still not fully understood. Pneumococcal evolution is dominated by recombination. The recombinational events usually involve genetic exchange with streptococci of the mitis group and some pneumococci are thought to exhibit hyper-recombination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has shown high efficacy in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by vaccine serotypes. We aimed to assess the overall effectiveness of PCV7 against IPD in Navarra, Spain. METHODS: All children aged {\textless}5 years who were diagnosed with IPD during the period 2001-2005 (n=85) and 5 control subjects per case patient (n=425), individually matched by birth date and birth hospital, were analyzed. Vaccination records were obtained from the regional immunization registry. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios. RESULTS: Eighteen case patients (21{\%}) and 114 control subjects (27{\%}) had received {\textgreater}or=1 dose of PCV7. PCV7 serotypes were responsible for 34 (51{\%}) of the cases in unvaccinated children. The overall effectiveness for case prevention was 31{\%} (odds ratio, 0.69; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.37-1.27). In a separate analysis, vaccination with PCV7 was 88{\%} effective in preventing IPD due to vaccine serotypes (odds ratio, 0.12; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.02-0.91) and was associated with a higher risk of IPD due to nonvaccine serogroups (odds ratio, 6.16; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.63-23.3). CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal a higher risk of IPD caused by non-PCV7 serogroups among vaccinated children. Consequently, the overall effectiveness of PCV7 for IPD prevention may be greatly reduced.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, but it is undoubtedly underdiagnosed. We used a nested PCR assay (targeting the pneumolysin gene) to detect S. pneumoniae DNA in multiple sample types from 474 adults with community-acquired pneumonia and 183 control patients who did not have pneumonia. Plasma or buffy coat samples were PCR positive in only 6 of the 21 patients with positive blood cultures for S. pneumoniae and in 12 other patients (4 of whom had no other laboratory evidence of S. pneumoniae infection). Buffy coat samples from two control patients (neither having evidence of S. pneumoniae infection), but no control plasma samples, were PCR positive. Although pneumococcal antigen was detected in the urine from 120 of 420 (29{\%}) patients, only 4 of 227 (2{\%}) urine samples tested were PCR positive. Overall, 256 of 318 (81{\%}) patients had PCR-positive sputum samples, including 58 of 59 samples from which S. pneumoniae was cultured. Throat swab samples from 229 of 417 (55{\%}) patients were PCR positive and, in those who produced sputum, 96{\%} also had positive PCR results from sputum. Throat swabs from 73 of 126 (58{\%}) control patients were also PCR positive. We conclude that the pneumolysin PCR assay adds little to existing diagnostic tests for S. pneumoniae and is unable to distinguish colonization from infection when respiratory samples are tested.},

@article{Sjoukes2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood infectious diseases and a significant reason for antibiotic prescriptions in children worldwide. Pain from middle ear infection and pressure behind the eardrum is the key symptom of AOM. Ear pain is central to children's and parents' experience of the illness. Because antibiotics provide only marginal benefits, analgesic treatment including paracetamol (acetaminophen) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is regarded as the cornerstone of AOM management in children. OBJECTIVES Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of paracetamol (acetaminophen) or NSAIDs, alone or combined, compared with placebo or no treatment in relieving pain in children with AOM. Our secondary objective was to assess the effectiveness of NSAIDs compared with paracetamol in children with AOM. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 7, July 2016; MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to August 2016), Embase (from 1947 to August 2016), CINAHL (from 1981 to August 2016), LILACS (from 1982 to August 2016) and Web of Science (from 1955 to August 2016) for published trials. We screened reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional trials. We searched WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR) for completed and ongoing trials (search date 19 August 2016). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, for pain relief in children with AOM. We also included trials of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, for children with fever or upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) if we were able to extract subgroup data on pain relief in children with AOM either directly or after obtaining additional data from study authors. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the included trials and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. MAIN RESULTS We included three RCTs (327 children) which were assessed at low to moderate risk of bias.One RCT included 219 children with AOM, and used a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind design to compare paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus placebo. All children also received antibiotics and those with fever {\textgreater} 39 °C could have received paracetamol (30 mg to 60 mg) additionally to the studied treatments.Another RCT involved 156 febrile children (26 of whom had AOM). The study design was a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind design and compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol.The third RCT included 889 children with respiratory tract infections (82 of whom had AOM). This study applied a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial, open-label design and compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol. Study participants were randomised to one of the three treatment groups as well as two dosing groups (regular versus as required) and two steam inhalation groups (steam versus no steam).Authors of two RCTs provided crude subgroup data on children with AOM. We used data from the remaining trial to inform comparison of paracetamol versus placebo (148 children) and ibuprofen versus placebo (146 children) assessments. Data from all included RCTs informed comparison of ibuprofen versus paracetamol (183 children); data from the two RCTs informed comparison of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone (71 children).We found evidence, albeit of low quality, that both paracetamol and ibuprofen as monotherapies were more effective than placebo in relieving pain at 48 hours (paracetamol versus placebo: proportion of children with pain 10{\%} versus 25{\%}, RR 0.38, 95{\%} CI 0.17 to 0.85; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 7; ibuprofen versus placebo: proportion of children with pain 7{\%} versus 25{\%}, RR 0.28, 95{\%} CI 0.11 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Very low quality evidence suggested that adverse events did not significantly differ between children treated with either paracetamol, ibuprofen or placebo.We found insufficient evidence of a difference between ibuprofen and paracetamol in relieving ear pain at 24 hours (2 RCTs, 39 children; RR 0.83, 95{\%} CI 0.59 to 1.18; very low quality evidence), 48 to 72 hours (3 RCTs, 183 children; RR 0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.54 to 1.54; low quality evidence) and four to seven days (2 RCTs, 38 children; RR 0.74, 95{\%} CI 0.17 to 3.23; very low quality evidence).Data on the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone came from two RCTs that provided crude subgroup data for 71 children with AOM. The small sample provided imprecise effect estimates and we were consequently unable to draw any firm conclusions (very low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Despite explicit guideline recommendations on its use, current evidence on the effectiveness of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, in relieving pain in children with AOM is limited. Low quality evidence indicates that both paracetamol and ibuprofen as monotherapies are more effective than placebo in relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM. There is insufficient evidence of a difference between ibuprofen and paracetamol in relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM, whereas data on the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone were insufficient to draw any firm conclusions. Further research is needed to provide insights into the role of ibuprofen as adjunct to paracetamol, and other analgesics such as anaesthetic eardrops, for children with AOM.},

METHODS: Data for all IPD episodes in children {\textless}18 years old treated at the Soroka University Medical Center during 2000 to 2009 were retrospectively retrieved. Episodes caused by SP1-IPD were compared with those caused by MCS-IPD (both grouped and individual serotypes). Analyses were adjusted for age and ethnicity.

RESULTS: Ninety-four SP1-IPD and 250 MCS-IPD episodes were documented. SP1-IPD cases were older (68.3 ± 52.6 months versus 30.4 ± 39.2 months; P {\textless} 0.001) and more likely to be found in Bedouin children than MCS-IPD (87.5{\%} versus 58.6{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). SP1 was less frequently isolated from patients with underlying disease than MCS (14.9{\%} versus 31.6 {\%}; P {\textless} 0.001; relative risk 0.15 [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.07-0.32]). SP1 was more often associated with bacteremic pneumonia and primary peritonitis than MCS (66{\%} versus 38.4{\%} and 7.4{\%} versus 0.8{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001); the proportion of bacteremia without focus was higher in MCS-IPD (32.4{\%} versus 12.5{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). There were no differences in hospitalization and mortality rates (70.2{\%} versus 68.0{\%} [P = 0.22] and 4.3{\%} versus 5.6{\%} [P = 0.26], respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: SP1 was found less frequently than MCS in children with underlying diseases, but it was more frequent in older and Bedouin children with IPD. SP1 was more frequently associated with bacteremic pneumonia and primary peritonitis than MCS grouped.},

In this study we estimated the effect of routine childhood immunization with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on frequent otitis media (3 episodes in 6 months or 4 episodes in 1 year) and pressure-equalizing tube insertions. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study population included all children who were enrolled at birth in TennCare or selected upstate New York commercial insurance plans as of July 1998 and continuously followed until 5 years old, loss of health plan enrollment, study outcome, or end of the study. We compared the risk of developing frequent otitis media or having pressure-equalizing tube insertion for 4 birth cohorts (1998-1999, 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002) by using Cox regression analysis. We used data from the National Immunization Survey to estimate the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine uptake for children in these 4 birth cohorts in Tennessee and New York. RESULTS The proportion of children in Tennessee and New York who received at least 3 doses of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by 2 years of age increased from {\textless} or = 1{\%} for the 1998-1999 birth cohort to approximately 75{\%} for the 2000-2001 birth cohort. By age 2 years, 29{\%} of Tennessee and New York children born in 2000-2001 had developed frequent otitis media, and 6{\%} of each of these birth cohorts had pressure-equalizing tubes inserted. Comparing the 2000-2001 birth cohort to the 1998-1999 birth cohort, frequent otitis media declined by 17{\%} and 28{\%}, and pressure-equalizing tube insertions declined by 16{\%} and 23{\%} for Tennessee and New York children, respectively. For the 2000-2001 to the 2001-2002 birth cohort, frequent otitis media and pressure-equalizing tubes remained stable in New York but increased in Tennessee. CONCLUSIONS After heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction, children were less likely to develop frequent otitis media or have pressure-equalizing tube insertions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children {\textless}5 years of age globally. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are known to provide protection against vaccine serotype pneumococcal pneumonia; uncertainty exists regarding the optimum PCV dosing schedule.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published from 1994 to 2010 (supplemented post hoc with studies from 2011) documenting the effect of PCV dosing schedules on clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema among children of ages targeted to receive vaccine. Data on 2- and 3-dose schedules were included. Percent change of pneumonia incidence rates from baseline to most recent year post-PCV introduction was calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 42 primary citations that evaluated PCV schedules and pneumonia. Thirty-seven (88{\%}) were from North America, Europe or Australia; 37 (88{\%}) evaluated PCV7 and 1 (2{\%}) PCV10. Two studies (both observational) compared multiple schedules within the study. We found evidence of reduced clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia incidence for all schedules, including 2+1 (1 nonrandomized trial, 5 observational studies), 3+0 (5 randomized trials, 2 observational studies) and 3+1 (5 clinical trials, 24 observational studies) schedules. The magnitude of disease impact did not differ among schedules. Evidence for impact on pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema varied.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: All schedules (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1) reduced clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Quantifying differences in pneumonia disease impact between schedules was difficult due to heterogeneity among studies in design, case definition and population. These findings support World Health Organization recommendations for 3-dose schedules administered as either 3+0 or 2+1 regimens. Pneumonia impact data are still needed on expanded serotype PCV products, developing country settings and the role for a booster dose.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The direct impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on colonization with unique PCV13 serotypes and the uptake of vaccine necessary to create indirect protection in nonimmunized children were assessed. METHODS: Carriage surveillance among children {\textless}60 months began in July 2010 at a pediatric practice in Boston, MA. Children had nasopharyngeal cultures and parents completed questionnaires detailing demographics and health status. Concurrently, we monitored uptake of PCV13 in children in the community. Children were classified as "presumed immune" or "presumed nonimmune" based on age and PCV13 immunizations received. We assessed trends using adjusted prevalence rates calculated within rolling, 25-week, consecutive intervals. RESULTS: Between July 2010 and June 2012, 1050 S. pneumoniae isolates were recovered from 1042 children. Eighty-nine isolates (8.5{\%}) were 1 of 6 unique PCV13 serotypes. The expected fall/winter peak in PCV13 carriage was observed in nonimmune children, but was blunted in immune children. There was a 74{\%} reduction in PCV13 colonization in immune compared with nonimmune children. We document a 50{\%} or more decline in the PCV13 carriage in nonimmune children, at the time when the approximately 75{\%} or more of the community children had received PCV13 and were considered immune. During the study, the difference in PCV13 serotype colonization prevalence in nonimmune and immune children disappeared. No evidence of replacement has been observed to date. CONCLUSIONS: The direct impact of PCV13 on colonization was demonstrated. Evidence of indirect protection in unimmunized (nonimmune) children was observed as vaccine uptake reached 75{\%} in the target community.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in Canada in 2001. Routine infant vaccination programs in Alberta began in 2002. Several years after PCV7 introduction, the routine use of PCV7 in infants and high-risk children has led to near elimination of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by vaccine serotypes. METHODS: Prospective, population-based surveillance of all IPD cases was conducted from January 1998 to December 2010. Demographic, clinical and microbiologic data were collected. RESULTS: There were 1462 IPD cases over 13 years. Comparing PCV7 serotype IPD incidence in the prevaccine period (1998-2001) to the late postvaccine period (2007-2010), there were declines in children 0-5 months (100{\%}), 6-23 months (98{\%}), 2-4 years (97{\%}), 5-15 years (100{\%}) as well as in adults 16-64 years (73{\%}), 65-84 years (90{\%}) and ≥85 years of age (100{\%}). From 2008 to 2010, there were no cases of PCV7 serotype IPD in children under 2 years of age. There have been increases in non-PCV7 serotype IPD; notably, serotypes 5 and 19A have increased significantly in adults and 19A in children. CONCLUSIONS: PCV7 serotype IPD has been eliminated in vaccine-eligible young children and nearly eliminated in all other age groups. Serotype 19A increased significantly at all ages before the introduction of an expanded valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVES Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae a member of the Viridans Streptococci, is known to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections (RTI). Very scanty information is available on the isolation of S. pseudopneumoniae from India. Hence, the present study was an attempt to isolate S. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to study their drug resistance pattern. METHODS Sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. Alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as S. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin susceptibility in 5 per cent CO₂ and ambient air. Disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. RESULTS Among the samples screened, 4 per cent showed the growth of only S. pseudopneumoniae. Other pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans. All the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin. INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results showed presence of S. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with RTI. Currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent CO₂ as S. pneumoniae and the resistant ones are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. As a result, S. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. Hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent CO₂ and ambient air along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. pseudopneumoniae.},

abstract = {Randomised controlled trials are widely accepted as the most reliable method of determining effectiveness, but most trials have evaluated the effects of a single intervention such as a drug. Recognition is increasing that other, non-pharmacological interventions should also be rigorously evaluated. 1–3 This paper examines the design and execution of research required to address the additional problems resulting from evalua-tion of complex interventions—that is, those " made up of various interconnecting parts. " 4 The issues dealt with are discussed in a longer Medical Research Council paper (www.mrc.ac.uk/complex{\_}packages.html). We focus on randomised trials but believe that this approach could be adapted to other designs when they are more appropriate. Challenges of trials of complex interventions There are specific difficulties in defining, developing, documenting, and reproducing complex interventions that are subject to more variation than a drug. A typical example would be the design of a trial to evaluate the benefits of specialist stroke units. Such a trial would have to consider the expertise of various health profes-sionals as well as investigations, drugs, treatment guidelines, and arrangements for discharge and follow up. Stroke units may also vary in terms of organisation, management, and skill mix. The active components of the stroke unit may be difficult to specify, making it difficult to replicate the intervention. The box gives other examples of complex interventions.},

Specific questions are related to the timing of colonisation measurement with respect to the time of vaccination, the adjustment for the within-host replacement of vaccine-type colonisation by the non-vaccine type pneumococci, and the impact of multiple serotype colonisation on VEcol estimation. We also discuss the issue of choosing the control vaccine, including comparison of two active pneumococcal vaccines, as well as the sample size and the statistical power of colonisation endpoint trials. In addition, the statistical design with the specific aim to include information about VEcol in the licensure process of new pneumococcal vaccine products is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) causes diseases from otitis media to life-threatening invasive infection. The species is extremely antigenically and clonally diverse. We wished to determine odds ratios (ORs) for serotypes and clones of S. pneumoniae that cause invasive disease in Finland. A total of 224 isolates of S. pneumoniae from cases of invasive disease in children {\textless}2 years of age in Finland between 1995 and 1999 were serotyped, and sequence types (STs) were determined by multilocus sequence typing. These STs were compared with a previously published carriage data set. STs from invasive disease were significantly less diverse than those from carriage (invasive disease, 0.038 +/- 0.01; carriage, 0.019 +/- 0.005). The ORs of serotypes 14, 18C, 19A, and 6B were significantly greater than 1, indicating association with invasive disease. The ORs of 6A and 11A were significantly less than 1. The difference between 6A and 6B is significant, which suggests that relatively subtle changes in the capsule may have a dramatic effect upon disease potential. We found that ST 156, the Spain(9V)-3 clone which mainly expressed serotype 14 in Finland, is strongly associated with invasive disease (OR, 10.1; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.3 to 79.5). Significant associations with invasive disease were also detected for STs 482, 191, 124, and 138, and associations with carriage were detected for STs 485 and 62. These results demonstrate the invasive phenotype of the serotype 14 variant of the Spain(9V)-3 clone and differences between members of the same serogroup in invasive disease potential.},

abstract = {Background The Streptococcus pneumoniae Invasive Disease network (SpIDnet) actively monitors populations in nine sites in seven European countries for invasive pneumococcal disease. Five sites use 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) alone and four use the ten-valent PCV (PCV10) and PCV13. Vaccination uptake is greater than 90{\%} in six sites and 67–78{\%} in three sites. We measured the effects of introducing high-valency PCVs on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years. Methods We compared the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in each of the 4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13 with the average incidence during the preceding period of heptavalent PCV (PCV7) use, overall and by serotype category. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95{\%} CIs for each year and pooled the values for all sites in a random effects meta-analysis. Findings 4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13, the pooled IRR was 0{\textperiodcentered}53 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}43–0{\textperiodcentered}65) for invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years caused by any serotype, 0{\textperiodcentered}16 (0{\textperiodcentered}07–0{\textperiodcentered}40) for disease caused by PCV7 serotypes, 0{\textperiodcentered}17 (0{\textperiodcentered}07–0{\textperiodcentered}42) for disease caused by 1, 5, and 7F serotypes, and 0{\textperiodcentered}41 (0{\textperiodcentered}25–0{\textperiodcentered}69) for that caused by 3, 6A and 19A serotypes. We saw a similar pattern when we restricted the analysis to sites where only PCV13 was used. The pooled IRR for invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes was 1{\textperiodcentered}62 (1{\textperiodcentered}09–2{\textperiodcentered}42). Interpretation The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by all serotypes decreased due to a decline in the incidence of vaccine serotypes. By contrast, that of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes increased, which suggests serotype replacement. Long-term surveillance will be crucial to monitor the further effects of PCV10 and PCV13 vaccination programmes in young children.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify key determinants explaining country-year variations in antibiotic use and resistance. METHODS: Ambulatory antibiotic use data [in defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DIDs)] for 19 European countries from 1999 to 2007 were collected, along with 181 variables describing countries in terms of their agriculture, culture, demography, disease burden, education, healthcare organization and socioeconomics. After assessing data availability, overlap and relevance, multiple imputation generalized estimating equations were applied with a stepwise selection procedure to select significant determinants of global antibiotic use (expressed in DIDs), relative use of subgroups (amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav) and resistance of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae. RESULTS: Relative humidity, healthcare expenditure proportional to gross domestic product, feelings of distrust, proportion of population aged {\textgreater}65 years and availability of treatment guidelines were associated with higher total antibiotic use expressed in DIDs. Restrictions on marketing activities towards prescribers, population density, number of antibiotics, educational attainment and degree of atheism were associated with a lower number of total DIDs used. Relative prescribing of amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav was mainly determined by healthcare system choices [e.g. general practitioner (GP) registration and restricted marketing]. Specific antibiotic use was found to be a significant determinant of resistance for some but not all drug/organism combinations. Incentives to stimulate GP gatekeeping were associated with lower levels of resistance, and life expectancy at age 65+ and atheism were associated with more resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Myriad factors influence antibiotic use and resistance at the country level and an important part of these can be modified by policy choices.},

AIM To evaluate the changing workload of middle ear disease in general practice, and the impact on surgery reattendance of prescribing antibiotics at first attendance. DESIGN OF STUDY A case-linked cohort analysis for antibiotic prescribing versus no prescribing at first consultation event. SETTING Two hundred and ninety-one practices spread throughout the UK recording for the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and incorporating individual patient data records for 2,265,574 patients. METHOD All middle ear disease coded events that can be classed within acute otitis media (AOM) or glue ear sub-categories (and excluding chronic suppurative otitis media) were selected for analysis when the first event was from 1991-2001. The effect of antibiotic prescription on the risk of reattendance using Cox proportional hazards regression was analysed. RESULTS Total consultations for AOM have fallen markedly over this decade, and glue ear consultations have risen but by a much smaller extent (26,000 decrease versus 4000 increase in consultations per year), which makes relabelling an unlikely explanation of the fall in AOM consultations. In the 2-10 years age range, consultations for AOM fell from 105.3 to 34.7 per 1000 per year, with glue ear consultations unaltered (15.2 to 16.7 per 1000 per year). Antibiotic prescribing for AOM has stayed remarkably constant (80-84{\%} of consultations), but antibiotic prescribing for glue ear has risen sharply (13 to 62{\%}). Prescribing antibiotics increased the risk of reattendance for AOM (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.10) and has reduced the risk of reattendance for glue ear (HR = 0.92, 95{\%} CI = 0.88 to 0.96). CONCLUSION Prescribing antibiotics for AOM probably increased reattendance, but the opposite effect has been noted for glue ear, which suggests a treatment effect of antibiotics in glue ear. Further research is needed to clarify whether this possible benefit is worth the known harms, and if so in which subgroups of children.},

abstract = {A double-blind, randomized study involving 264 toddlers attending day care centers was conducted to document the effect of a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the carriage rate of pneumococci. Of 3750 cultures done on nasopharyngeal samples obtained from subjects during a 2-year follow-up period after vaccination, 65{\%} were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae. In all age windows, the rate of carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci was lower among subjects who received the pneumococcal vaccine than among control subjects, because the acquisition rate was lower in the former group. The effect was most pronounced among subjects aged {\textless} or =36 months. The sample size enabled us to study protection against carriage of S. pneumoniae serotypes 6B, 9V, 14, 19F, and 23F; significant protection against all serotypes except 19F was seen in the pneumococcal-vaccine group. The rate of carriage of serotype 6A (not included in the vaccine) was also reduced significantly, but the rate of carriage of serotype 19A (not included in the vaccine) was not. The rate of carriage of non-vaccine-type pneumococci (excluding serotype 6A) was higher in the pneumococcal-vaccine group than in the control group.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed disease in ambulatory care and Streptococcuspneumoniae continues to be the most common bacterial agent. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics underscores the need for better vaccines. Current pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are modestly protective against otitis media; however, limited serotype coverage and serotype replacement have led to the investigation of pneumococcal proteins as potential vaccine candidates. Two proteins, pneumococcal surface proteins A (PspA) and C (PspC) are important virulence factors, expressed by virtually all strains. Although a number of pneumococcal proteins have been investigated in other infection sites, these proteins can have diverse organ-specific effects. In this study, we investigated the viability and virulence of single (PspA(-) and PspC(-)) and double (PspA(-)/PspC(-)) mutants of pneumococcal PspA and PspC proteins in the chinchilla middle ear. METHODS Bullae of 24 chinchillas were inoculated with 0.5 ml of 10(6) colony forming units (CFUs)/ml bacteria: 6 with wild-type D39 strain; 6 with PspA(-); 6 with PspC(-); and 6 with PspA(-)/PspC(-) isogenic mutant strains. Bacterial CFU levels in middle ear effusions and light microscopic analysis of the number of inflammatory cells in the round window membrane (RWM) were compared 48 h after inoculation. RESULTS At 48 h, CFUs in middle ears were increased for wild-type and PspC(-) strains compared to inoculum levels; however, they were significantly less for the group inoculated with the PspC(-) strain compared to wild-type strain. No bacteria were detected in the PspA(-) and PspA(-)/PspC(-) groups. The number of inflammatory cells in the RWM was significantly higher in wild-type compared to the PspA(-), PspC(-), and PspA(-)/PspC(-) groups. No significant difference in number of inflammatory cells was observed between any pairs of groups inoculated with mutant strains. CONCLUSION Viability and virulence of the PspC(-) strain were similar to the wild-type strain. The single PspA(-) and double PspA(-)/PspC(-) mutants were highly attenuated in the ear. Bacterial clearance of the PspA(-)/PspC(-) double mutant was indistinguishable from that of the PspA mutant. These studies provide no reason to exclude PspC from a multi-component protein vaccine containing PspA.},

abstract = {Introduction Obtaining a preoperative audiogram prior to tympanostomy tube placement is recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery clinical practice guideline (CPG): Tympanostomy tubes in Children, and this process measure is also used as a quality metric by payers. However, whether audiograms should be mandated in cases of tube placement for both chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) and recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) is controversial. The objective of this study is to determine reports of practice patterns of pediatric otolaryngologists regarding obtaining audiograms before and after tympanostomy tube placement and opinions regarding utility of CPGs and use of this process measure as a quality metric. Methods A 16-question cross-sectional survey of American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology (ASPO) members was conducted. Per ASPO policy, no repeated requests or other enhanced response techniques were permitted. Independent t-tests for proportions were used to compare responses. Results 127 pediatric otolaryngologists completed the survey (response rate 26.9{\%}). Nearly 70{\%} of respondents reported being in practice for {\textgreater}10 years. 74{\%} of respondents reported obtaining preoperative audiograms “always” or “most of the time” for COME, vs. 56.7{\%} for RAOM (p {\textless} 0.0001). 76{\%} agreed that obtaining a preoperative audiogram was representative of high quality for COME, vs. 52{\%} for RAOM (p {\textless} 0.0001). 12{\%} of respondents “completely agreed” that compliance with all aspects of CPGs represented high quality, while 68.8{\%} responded that they somewhat agreed. Conclusion There is no consensus among pediatric otolaryngologists regarding the necessity of a preoperative audiogram in tympanostomy tube placement, especially for RAOM. Further evidence demonstrating the benefit of preoperative audiogram obtainment should be developed prior to inclusion as a guideline recommendation and as a quality metric.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the administration of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a region with an intermediate vaccination coverage. A matched case-control study was carried out in children aged 7-59 months with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) admitted to two university hospitals in Catalonia. Three controls matched for hospital, age, sex, date of hospitalization and underlying disease were selected for each case. Information on the vaccination status of cases and controls was obtained from the vaccination card, the child's health card, the hospital medical record or the vaccination register of the primary healthcare center where the child was attended for non-severe conditions. A conditional logistic regression analysis was made to control for the effect of possible confounding variables. The adjusted vaccination effectiveness of the complete vaccination schedule (3 doses at 2, 4 and 6 months and a fourth dose at 15 months, 2 doses at least two months apart in children aged 12-23 months or a single dose in children aged {\textgreater}24 months) in preventing IPD caused by vaccine serotypes was 93.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 51.8-99.2). It was not effective in preventing cases caused by non-vaccine serotypes. The results of this study carried out in a population with intermediate vaccination coverage confirm those of other observational studies showing high levels of effectiveness of routine 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination.},

abstract = {This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is a revision of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline from the American Academy of Pe- diatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians. It provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM. In 2009, the AAP convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, oto- laryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern Califor- nia Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the new literature related to AOM since the initial evidence report of 2000. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures. It also addresses recur- rent AOM, which was not included in the 2004 guideline. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guid- ance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or es- tablish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommend- ations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem. Pediatrics},

abstract = {Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the nasopharynx is critical for an understanding of transmission, estimates of vaccine efficacy, and possible replacement disease. Conventional nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) culture and serotyping (the WHO protocol) is likely to underestimate multiple-serotype carriage. We compared the WHO protocol with methods aimed at improving cocolonization detection. One hundred twenty-five NPSs from an infant pneumococcal-carriage study, containing ≥ 1 serotype by WHO culture, were recultured in duplicate. A sweep of colonies from one plate culture was serotyped by latex agglutination. DNA extracted from the second plate was analyzed by S. pneumoniae molecular-serotyping microarray. Multiple serotypes were detected in 11.2{\%} of the swabs by WHO culture, 43.2{\%} by sweep serotyping, and 48.8{\%} by microarray. Sweep and microarray were more likely to detect multiple serotypes than WHO culture (P {\textless} 0.0001). Cocolonization detection rates were similar between microarray and sweep, but the microarray identified the greatest number of serotypes. A common serogroup type was identified in 95.2{\%} of swabs by all methods. WHO methodology significantly underestimates multiple-serotype carriage compared to these alternate methods. Sweep serotyping is cost-effective and field deployable but may fail to detect serotypes at low abundance, whereas microarray serotyping is more costly and technology dependent but may detect these additional minor carried serotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Otitis media (OM) is amongst the most common childhood diseases and is associated with multiple microbial pathogens within the middle ear. Global and temporal monitoring of predominant bacterial pathogens is important to inform new treatment strategies, vaccine development and to monitor the impact of vaccine implementation to improve progress toward global OM prevention. METHODS A systematic review of published reports of microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) from January, 1970 to August 2014, was performed using PubMed databases. RESULTS This review confirmed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, remain the predominant bacterial pathogens, with S. pneumoniae the predominant bacterium in the majority reports from AOM patients. In contrast, H. influenzae was the predominant bacterium for patients experiencing chronic OME, recurrent AOM and AOM with treatment failure. This result was consistent, even where improved detection sensitivity from the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than bacterial culture was conducted. On average, PCR analyses increased the frequency of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 3.2 fold compared to culture, whilst Moraxella catarrhalis was 4.5 times more frequently identified by PCR. Molecular methods can also improve monitoring of regional changes in the serotypes and identification frequency of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae over time or after vaccine implementation, such as after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS Globally, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain the predominant otopathogens associated with OM as identified through bacterial culture; however, molecular methods continue to improve the frequency and accuracy of detection of individual serotypes. Ongoing monitoring with appropriate detection methods for OM pathogens can support development of improved vaccines to provide protection from the complex combination of otopathogens within the middle ear, ultimately aiming to reduce the risk of chronic and recurrent OM in vulnerable populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) at the population level is unclear. We explored PCV13's effect in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)-related morbidity and mortality, and whether serotype-specific changes were attributable to vaccination or expected as a part of natural, cyclical variations.

METHODS: This was a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study based on the linkage of laboratory surveillance data and the Danish Civil Registration System. Changes in IPD incidence and mortality during baseline (2000-2007), 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) (2008-2010), and PCV13 (2011-2013) periods were estimated. Predicted incidences of serotypes were estimated controlling for cyclical trends from historical patterns observed during the past 20 years.

RESULTS: We observed a 21{\%} reduction (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 17{\%}-25{\%}) in IPD incidence in the total population after PCV13's introduction, and a 71{\%} reduction (95{\%} CI, 62{\%}-79{\%}) in children aged {\textless}2 years, considered as the vaccine effectiveness. We estimated a 28{\%} reduction (95{\%} CI, 18{\%}-37{\%}) in IPD-related 30-day mortality, from 3.4 deaths (95{\%} CI, 3.2-3.6) per 100 000 population in the pre-PCV period to 2.4 (95{\%} CI, 2.2-2.7) in the PCV13 period. The decline in mortality was observed across all age groups but was mainly related to mortality reductions in the nonvaccinated population. For serotypes 1 and 3, there were no significant changes in incidence beyond what would be expected from natural cyclical patterns. Serotype 19A significantly increased following PCV7's introduction, but the incidence declined toward baseline in 2012.

CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 has brought greater benefits than we had expected in our setting. We observed a further decline on IPD incidence shortly after the shift from PCV7 to PCV13 in the national immunization program. This decline was accompanied by a substantial population-level decline in pneumococcal-related mortality of nearly 30{\%} among nonvaccinated persons.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Serious lower respiratory tract infections (SLRTIs), especially Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP)-related pneumonia cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Chest imaging, sputum and blood culture are not routinely obtained by general practitioners (GPs). Antibiotic therapy is usually started empirically. The BinaxNOW{\textregistered} and Urine Antigen Detection (UAD) assays have been developed respectively to detect a common antigen from all pneumococcal strains and the 13 pneumococcal serotypes present in the vaccine Prevenar 13{\textregistered} (PCV13). METHODS OPUS-B was a multicentre, prospective, case-control, observational study of patients with SLRTI in primary care in Belgium, conducted during two winter seasons (2011-2013). A urine sample was collected at baseline for the urine assays. GPs were blinded to the results. All patients with a positive BinaxNOW{\textregistered} test and twice as much randomly selected BinaxNOW{\textregistered} negative patients were followed up. Recorded data included: socio-demographics, medical history, vaccination history, clinical symptoms, CRB-65 score, treatments, hospitalization, blood cultures, healthcare use, EQ-5D score. The objectives were to evaluate the percentage of SP SLRTI within the total number of SLRTIs, to assess the percentage of SP serotypes and to compare the burden of disease between pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal SLRTIs. RESULTS There were 26 patients with a BinaxNOW{\textregistered} positive test and 518 patients with a BinaxNOW{\textregistered} negative test. The proportion of pneumococcal SLRTI was 4.8 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 3.1 {\%}-7.2 {\%}). Sixty-eight percent of positive cases showed serotypes represented in PCV13. In the BinaxNOW-positive patients, women were more numerous, there was less exposure to young children, seasonal influenza vaccination was less frequent, COPD was more frequent, the body temperature and the number of breaths per minute were higher, the systolic blood pressure was lower, the frequency of sputum, infiltrate, chest pain, muscle ache, confusion/disorientation, diarrhoea, pneumonia and exacerbations of COPD was more frequent, EQ-5D index and VAS scale were lower, the number of visits to the GP, of working days lost and of days patients needed assistance were higher. CONCLUSIONS SP was responsible for approximately 5 {\%} of SLRTIs observed in primary care in Belgium. Pneumococcal infection was associated with a significant increase in morbidity. Sixty-eight percent of serotypes causing SLRTI were potentially preventable by PCV13.},

abstract = {Over the last decade infant pneumococcal vaccination has been adopted as part of routine immunisation schedules in many developed countries. Although highly successful in many settings such as Australia and the United States, rapid serotype replacement has occurred in some European countries. Recently two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) with extended serotype coverage have been licensed for use, a 10-valent (PHiD-CV) and a 13-valent (PCV-13) vaccine, and offer potential replacements for the existing vaccine (PCV-7) in Australia. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCV programs we developed a static, deterministic state-transition model. The perspective for costs included those to the government and healthcare system. When compared to current practice (PCV-7) both vaccines offered potential benefits, with those estimated for PHiD-CV due primarily to prevention of otitis media and PCV-13 due to a further reduction in invasive disease in Australia. At equivalent total cost to vaccinate an infant, compared to no PCV the base-case cost per QALY saved were estimated at A{\$}64,900 (current practice, PCV-7; 3. +. 0), A{\$}50,200 (PHiD-CV; 3. +. 1) and A{\$}55,300 (PCV-13; 3. +. 0), respectively. However, assumptions regarding herd protection, serotype protection, otitis media efficacy, and vaccination cost changed the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative PCV programs. The high proportion of current invasive disease caused by serotype 19A (as included in PCV-13) may be a decisive factor in determining vaccine policy in Australia. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) revised recommendations for adult pneumococcal vaccination to include a sequential regimen of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for certain high-risk adults with immunocompromising conditions. This study, from a payer perspective, examined: (1) the cost-effectiveness of the new 2012 ACIP vaccine policy recommendation relative to the 1997 ACIP recommendation; (2) the cost-effectiveness of potential future pneumococcal vaccination policies; and (3) key assumptions that influence study results. METHODS: A static cohort model that incorporated costs, health outcomes, and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses associated with invasive pneumococcal disease and non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP) was developed to evaluate seven pneumococcal vaccination strategies for a 50-year-old adult cohort over a 50-year period using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: For objective 1, the 2012 ACIP recommendation is the more economically efficient strategy (ICER was {\$}25,841 per QALY gained vs. no vaccination). For objective 2, the most efficient vaccination policy would be to maintain the 2012 recommendation for PPSV23 for healthy and immunocompetent adults with comorbidities, and to modify the recommendation for adults with immunocompromising conditions by replacing PPSV23 with a sequential regimen of PCV13 and PPSV23 at age 65 (ICER was {\$}23,416 per QALY gained vs. no vaccination). For objective 3, cost-effectiveness ratios for alternative pneumococcal vaccine policies were highly influenced by assumptions used for vaccine effectiveness against NBPP and accounting for the herd protection effects of pediatric PCV13 vaccination on adult pneumococcal disease. CONCLUSION: Modifying the 2012 recommendation to include an additional dose of PCV13 at age 65, followed by PPSV23, for adults with immunocompromising conditions appears to be a cost-effective vaccine policy. Given the uncertainty in the available data and the absence of key influential data, comprehensive sensitivity analyses should be conducted by policy-makers when evaluating new adult pneumococcal vaccine strategies.},

abstract = {A seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduced in the United States in 2000 has been shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in both vaccinated children and adults through induction of herd immunity. We assessed the impact of infant immunization on pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and mortality in all age groups using Health Care Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases (SID) for 1996 to 2006 from 10 states; SID contain 100{\%} samples of ICD9-coded hospitalization data for the selected states. Compared to a 1996-1997 through 1998-1999 baseline, by the 2005-2006 season, both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths had decreased substantially in all age groups, including a 47{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 38 to 54{\%}) reduction in nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (ICD9 code 481 with no codes indicating IPD) in infants {\textless}2 years old and a 54{\%} reduction (CI, 53 to 56{\%}) in adults ≥65 years of age. A model developed to calculate the total burden of pneumococcal pneumonia prevented by infant PCV7 vaccination in the United States from 2000 to 2006 estimated a reduction of 788,838 (CI, 695,406 to 875,476) hospitalizations for pneumococcal pneumonia. Ninety percent of the reduction in model-attributed pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations occurred through herd immunity among adults 18 years old and older; similar proportions were found in pneumococcal disease mortality prevented by the vaccine. In the first seasons after PCV introduction, when there were substantial state differences in coverage among {\textless}5-year-olds, states with greater coverage had significantly fewer influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among children, suggesting that PCV7 use also reduces influenza-attributable pneumonia hospitalizations.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of mastoiditis in Iceland, especially in children, and the possible correlation with antibiotic usage. Patients with mastoiditis during 1984-2002 were identified and information on antibiotic usage in children in the y 1989-2002 was obtained. 84 patients were diagnosed with mastoiditis during 1984-2002, 52 (62{\%}) of whom were less than 18 y of age. 26 (50{\%}) children were less than 3 y of age. During the y 1999-2002, 28 children were diagnosed with mastoiditis, of whom 15 (54{\%}) were diagnosed with otitis media within a week prior to admission. 11 (73{\%}) were treated with antibiotics and 4 (27{\%}) were not. During 1989-2002 a correlation was detected between decreased antibiotic usage in children and increased incidence of mastoiditis (r=-0.68; p=0.007). Following changes in guidelines for antibiotic prescriptions for otitis media in Iceland during the 1990s, antibiotic usage decreased but the incidence of mastoiditis increased. It is uncertain if this is a causal relationship. It is important to treat otitis media correctly while being alert for complications, especially in young children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There is a continuing interest in defining the incidence, prevalence and burden of otitis media (OM) in the individual and population for purposes of assigning "risk factors". Often overlooked in past studies are the contributions of cold-like illnesses (CLIs) and sampling interval to those estimates. OBJECTIVE Describe the incidence of symptomatic (AOM) and asymptomatic (OME) OM, the prevalence of OM, the contribution of CLI incidence, burden and other OM "risk factors" to the incidence and burden of OM, and the effect of sampling interval on those measures in children. METHODS 148 children (74 male; 131 white, aged 1.0-8.6 years) were followed from November 1 to April 30 by weekly pneumatic otoscopy to diagnose OM presence/absence and by daily parental diary to assign CLI episodes. Data for previously identified OM "risk factors" were collected on 127. Results were summarized using standard measures of incidence, prevalence and burden, and multiple regression techniques were used to identify OM "risk factors". RESULTS The basal OM prevalence was 20{\%} with peaks in December and March and the temporal pattern was correlated with CLI prevalence. The incidence of OME (per 27,232 child-days) was 317, AOM was 74 and CLI was 456. The seasonal pattern of AOM and OME incidences tracked and was correlated with that for CLIs. New OM episodes were usually of short duration ({\textless}or=7 days in 40{\%}, {\textless}or=4 weeks in 75-90{\%}) and the usual OM burden was low (median=12{\%}). OM and breastfeeding histories and CLI incidence/prevalence were significant predictors of OME and AOM incidence and OM burden. Longer sampling intervals were less efficient in capturing AOM and OME durations and incidences, but not OM burden. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate a high incidence and prevalence of OM, most OM episodes were of short duration and longer sampling intervals introduced biases into some parameter estimates. There was a significant relationship between OM and CLI incidence, prevalence and burden suggesting that CLI experience should be controlled for in assessing independent "risk factors" for AOM and OME.},

abstract = {Respiratory tract infection (RTI) is defined as any infectious disease of the upper or lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include the common cold, laryngitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute rhinitis, acute rhinosinusitis and acute otitis media. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) include acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia and tracheitis. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for RTIs in adults and children in primary care. General practice consultation rates in England and Wales show that a quarter of the population will visit their GP because of an RTI each year (Ashworth et al. 2005). RTIs are the reason for 60{\%} of all antibiotic prescribing in general practice, and this constitutes a significant cost to the NHS. Annual prescribing costs for acute cough alone exceed {\pounds}15 million (Lindbaek 2006). There is evidence from randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) that antibiotics have limited efficacy in treating a large proportion of RTIs in adults and children (see section 2). These include acute otitis media (AOM), acute cough/acute bronchitis, acute sore throat/acute pharyngitis/acute tonsillitis, acute rhinosinusitis and the common cold. These conditions are largely self-limiting and complications are likely to be rare if antibiotics are withheld. Therefore, these five common RTIs are the focus of this guideline. The inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics has the potential to cause drug-related adverse events, escalate the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in the community and increase primary care consultation rates for minor illness (Standing Medical Advisory Committee 1998).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of antimicrobial consumption with the carriage rate of penicillin resistant and multiresistant pneumococci in children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Cross sectional and analytical prevalence study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Five different communities in Iceland.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin resistant pneumococci in children aged under 7 years in relation to antibiotic use as determined by information from parents, patient's records, and total sales of antimicrobials from local pharmacies in four study areas.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Total antimicrobial sales for children (6223 prescriptions) among the four areas for which data were available ranged from 9.6 to 23.2 defined daily doses per 1000 children daily (1.1 to 2.6 courses yearly per child). Children under 2 consumed twice as much as 2-6 year olds (20.5 v 10.9 defined daily doses per 1000 children daily). Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained from 919 children, representing 15-38{\%} of the peer population groups in the different areas. Pneumococci were carried by 484 (52.7{\%}) of the children, 47 (9.7{\%}) of the isolates being resistant to penicillin or multiresistant. By multivariate analysis age ({\textless} 2 years), area (highest antimicrobial consumption), and individual use of antimicrobials significantly influenced the odds of carrying penicillin resistant pneumococci. By univariate analysis, recent antimicrobial use (two to seven weeks) and use of co-trimoxazole were also significantly associated with carriage of penicillin resistant pneumococci.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial use, with regard to both individual use and total antimicrobial consumption in the community, is strongly associated with nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin resistant pneumococci in children. Control measures to reduce the prevalence of penicillin resistant pneumococci should include reducing the use of antimicrobials in community health care.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is one of the most important bacterial pathogens and a leading cause of mucosal infections (e.g. otitis media) and various forms of serious diseases (e.g. pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia) in developing and developed countries. Based on the polysaccharide capsule, there are at least 90 different pneumococcal serotypes, which may compete with each other to colonize the nasopharynx. Newly developed protein-polysaccharide conjugated vaccines have been shown to provide protection against disease caused by the serotypes included in the vaccine, and also against colonization (carriage). It is feared that yet uncommon, but nonetheless pathogenic serotypes which have been suppressed by competition, may become more prevalent in carriage and disease after large-scale use of conjugate vaccines. In this paper, we use transmission models of pneumococcal carriage to study how competition and vaccination influence the coexistence of two serotypes. According to our results, direct (physical) competition between two pneumococcal serotypes only influences colonization if the duration of naturally acquired immunity is short. By contrast, indirect (antibody-mediated) competition is of influence only if naturally acquired immunity is long lasting. Vaccination reduces the prevalence of the target serotype--an effect that is enforced by the presence of directly competing bacteria. The emergence of a non-target serotype after vaccination is only observed if bacteria compete directly. These results emphasize the importance of studying whether bacteria compete directly or indirectly and for how long people are protected in order to assess the long-term effects of sero-competition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Animal models suggest that influenza infection favors nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococci. We assessed this relationship with influenza and other respiratory viruses in young children. METHODS A case-control study was nested within a prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Andean children {\textless}3 years of age (RESPIRA-PERU study). Weekly household visits were made to identify ARI and obtain nasal swabs for viral detection using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Monthly nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were obtained to assess pneumococcal colonization. We determined whether specific respiratory viral ARI episodes occurring within the interval between NP samples increased the risk of NP acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes. RESULTS A total of 729 children contributed 2128 episodes of observation, including 681 pneumococcal acquisition episodes (new serotype, not detected in prior sample), 1029 nonacquisition episodes (no colonization or persistent colonization with the same serotype as the prior sample), and 418 indeterminate episodes. The risk of pneumococcal acquisition increased following influenza-ARI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.02-4.69) and parainfluenza-ARI (AOR, 1.86; 95{\%} CI, 1.15-3.01), when compared with episodes without ARI. Other viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus) were not associated with acquisition. CONCLUSIONS Influenza and parainfluenza ARIs appeared to facilitate pneumococcal acquisition among young children. As acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases, these observations are pivotal in our attempts to prevent pneumococcal disease.},

abstract = {From the study of bacterial infections in man and the lower animals evidence has been accumulated that pathogenic organisms do not produce harmful effects from their mere physical presence. The general reaction or toxemia of infection is differentiated from the local process which in many instances is the only tangible expression of bacterial invasion. Substances of a harmful nature seem to pass out from the bacteria and through the circulating medium of the animal to ilijure cells and organs at a distance from the site of infection. An explanation of the nature and mode of action of these substances has been one of the great problems in the study of infection. Certain bacteria, such as diphtheria, tetanus, and others, when grown in artificial media form a soluble toxin whose action when injected into animals differs in no way from that manifested when the same bacteria grow in living tissue. The majority of pathogenic bacteria are not known to form these soluble toxins during their life processes. The capacity of the latter to intoxicate has been explained by their setting free upon death a toxin which during life is retained within the cell body. Some investigators hold the view that intoxication by these bacteria arises in the body of the infected animal from the splitting of the bacterial protein into toxic degradation products. These explanations of bacterial intoxication are not so satisfactory nor so well substantiated as are the facts concerning infection w i t h bacteria which produce known soluble toxins. Pneumococcus is a highly pathogenic microorganism which is not known to secrete a soluble toxin, and whose harmful effects are sup-posed to be due either to the setting free of intracellular toxins or 477 478 ELABORATION OF SPECIFIC SOLUBLE SUBSTANCE to the formation on disintegration of toxic split products. In the present paper it is shown that this organism during the early stages of its growth forms a readily soluble substance which diffuses into the culture medium in vitro, and in human and animal infections is present in the circulating blood, whence it passes through the kidneys into the urine. We have not as yet been able to demonstrate with certainty that this substance is responsible for the intoxication that accompanies lobar pneumonia.},

We examined whether donor immunization with a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) would elicit protective antibody responses to additional doses of vaccine administered early after transplantation. Ninety-six patients scheduled to receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant were randomized with their donors to receive either a dose of PCV7 vaccine or no vaccine before transplantation. All patients received PCV7 at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months following transplantation, and serotype-specific antibody concentrations were determined after each dose. Following HCT, geometric mean antibody concentrations of patients in the immunized donor group were significantly higher for 5 of the 7 vaccine serotypes after one dose (P {\textless}.05) and for 4 of the 7 serotypes after 2 doses of vaccine (P {\textless}.03). Sixty-seven percent of patients in the immunized donor group had presumed protective IgG concentrations more than or equal to 0.50 microg/mL to all 7 serotypes following the first dose of vaccine compared to 36{\%} in the unimmunized donor group (P =.05). After the third dose of vaccine, both groups had more than 60{\%} of patients with concentrations at least 0.50 microg/mL to all vaccine serotypes. Donor immunization enhances early antibody responses of patients undergoing HCT to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. A 3-dose schedule of PCV7 vaccine at 3, 6, and 12 months is immunogenic in these patients regardless of donor immunization.},

AIM: We sought to determine the savings in medical costs through 36 months of life attributable to the use of the vaccine in healthy infants in a large randomized trial. METHODS: We analyzed the actual medical costs of 36 471 children involved in a randomized trial of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine conducted in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. The costs of the vaccine and vaccine administration were excluded. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the vaccinated group experienced a 2{\%} reduction in clinic related costs [{\$}48; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), {\$}10 to {\$}83] and a nearly significant 14{\%} reduction in outpatient hospitalization costs ({\$}32; CI -{\$}1 to {\$}66). The savings in total medical costs were 1.2{\%}, but this difference was not significant ({\$}41; CI -{\$}204 to {\$}270). Inpatient hospital costs were highly variable and were responsible for the lack of precision in the difference in total cost. In a post hoc analysis that excluded hospital costs not believed to be potentially pneumococcal related, savings in medical costs were {\$}78 and significant (CI {\$}5 to {\$}158). CONCLUSIONS: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reduced ambulatory care costs in children in the first 36 months of life, but without a larger trial, the magnitude of the savings in total medical costs is uncertain. These results indicate, however, that any medical cost savings that are associated with the vaccine are unlikely to be high enough to offset the cost of the vaccine at its current price.},

STUDY DESIGN Children enrolled in the Wheezing-Illnesses-STudy-LEidsche-Rijn cohort with at least 1 episode of AOM documented in their primary care health record before 2 years of age were followed until 6 years of age. Data on episodes of AOM and associated primary care consultations, antibiotic prescriptions, and specialist referrals were retrieved. Regression models assessed the presence and shape of the associations between age of first AOM and subsequent episodes of AOM and health care use. RESULTS A total of 796 of 2026 children (39{\%}) experienced a first AOM before 2 years of age. Each month decrease in age at first AOM in the first 2 years of life increased the risk of developing recurrent AOM (≥3 AOM episodes in 6 months or ≥ 4 in 1 year) linearly by 6{\%} (adjusted risk ratio: 1.06; 95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.10). For first AOM occurring before 9 months, the cumulative 6-year primary care consultation rate increased by 8{\%} (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 1.08; 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.15) and the associated specialist referral increased by 16{\%} (adjusted risk ratio: 1.16; 95{\%} CI: 1.07-1.27) for each month decrease in age. No associations were found between age at first AOM and total AOM episodes or antibiotic prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS The association between earlier age of first AOM and recurrent AOM as well as total health care use during childhood is particularly strong before 9 months of age.},

The purpose of this study was to explore antibiotic prescribing practices among Icelandic physicians and compare the results with results of comparable studies from 1991 and 1995 conducted by the Directorate of Health, Iceland. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among all general practitioners registered in Iceland in 1991 and 1995 and all physicians registered in March 2014. Data was collected with questionnaires regarding diagnosis and treatment of simple urinary tract infection, acute otitis media and pharyngitis. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed and level of significance p≤0.05. RESULTS Response rates were 85{\%} and 93{\%} in 1991 and 1995 but 31{\%} in 2014. Proportion of physicians who consider themselves prescribing antibiotics more than 10 times per week was 36{\%} in 1991, 32{\%} in 1995 and 21{\%} in 2014. Proportion of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as first choice for simple urinary tract infection reduced from 43{\%} and 45{\%} to 8{\%} in 2014. In 2014, general practitioners considered themselves 87{\%} less likely to prescribe an antibiotic for acute otitis media than in 1991 (p{\textless}0.001). They also claimed to use rapid diagnostic tests in pharyngitis five times more often in 2014 than in 1991 (p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSION Antibiotic prescribing practices have changed significantly in the past two decades in Iceland becoming more in line with clinical guidelines. Improvements are still needed to further reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.},

abstract = {The force of infection is one of the primary epidemiological parameters of infectious diseases. For many infectious diseases it is assumed that the force of infection is age-dependent. Although the force of infection can be estimated directly from a follow up study, it is much more common to have cross-sectional seroprevalence data from which the prevalence and the force of infection can be estimated. In this paper, we propose to model the force of infection within the framework of fractional polynomials. We discuss several parametric examples from the literature and show that all of these examples can be expressed as special cases of fractional polynomial models. We illustrate the method on five seroprevalence samples, two of Hepatitis A, and one of Rubella, Mumps and Varicella.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk factors for febrile, respiratory, and gastrointestinal illnesses in preschool children at day care centres have not been adequately identified and may differ between countries. METHODS: In this repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal study of children at day care centres, we analyzed various potential risk factors for infectious illnesses using a mixed effect hierarchical Poisson regression model. The results of the analyses and the incidence rates of these illnesses are reported herein. RESULTS: The study lasted 2.5 y (2000-2003) and was divided into five 6-month periods (seasons). Nine hundred and seventeen children participated, and their mean age within each season was 3.6-4.1 y. The only consistent risk factors identified were young age and winter season. No consistent risk factors at the day care centres (facilities or hygiene practices) were identified. The incidences of the febrile, respiratory, and gastrointestinal illnesses varied significantly between seasons (winter/summer) and between age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors of infectious illnesses are difficult to identify and because they may vary between countries, international recommendations on expensive intervention strategies are not justifiable. Rates of respiratory illnesses in Icelandic preschool children appear higher than in other countries, but rates of gastrointestinal illnesses lower.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inclusion of vaccine herd-protection effects in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) can impact the CEAs-conclusions. However, empirical epidemiologic data on the size of herd-protection effects from original studies are limited. METHODS: We performed a quantitative comparative analysis of the impact of herd-protection effects in CEAs for four childhood vaccinations (pneumococcal, meningococcal, rotavirus and influenza). We considered CEAs reporting incremental-cost-effectiveness-ratios (ICERs) (per quality-adjusted-life-years [QALY] gained; per life-years [LY] gained or per disability-adjusted-life-years [DALY] avoided), both with and without herd protection, while keeping all other model parameters stable. We calculated the size of the ICER-differences without vs with-herd-protection and estimated how often inclusion of herd-protection led to crossing of the cost-effectiveness threshold (of an assumed societal-willingness-to-pay) of {\$}50,000 for more-developed countries or X3GDP/capita (WHO-threshold) for less-developed countries. RESULTS: We identified 35 CEA studies (20 pneumococcal, 4 meningococcal, 8 rotavirus and 3 influenza vaccines) with 99 ICER-analyses (55 per-QALY, 27 per-LY and 17 per-DALY). The median ICER-absolute differences per QALY, LY and DALY (without minus with herd-protection) were {\$}15,620 (IQR: {\$}877 to {\$}48,376); {\$}54,871 (IQR: {\$}787 to {\$}115,026) and {\$}49 (IQR: {\$}15 to {\$}1,636) respectively. When the target-vaccination strategy was not cost-saving without herd-protection, inclusion of herd-protection always resulted in more favorable results. In CEAs that had ICERs above the cost-effectiveness threshold without herd-protection, inclusion of herd-protection led to crossing of that threshold in 45{\%} of the cases. This impacted only CEAs for more developed countries, as all but one CEAs for less developed countries had ICERs below the WHO-cost-effectiveness threshold even without herd-protection. In several analyses, recommendation for the adoption of the target vaccination strategy depended on the inclusion of the herd protection effect. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of herd-protection effects in CEAs had a substantial impact in the estimated ICERs and made target-vaccination strategies more attractive options in almost half of the cases where ICERs were above the societal-willingness to pay threshold without herd-protection. More empirical epidemiologic data are needed to determine the size of herd-protection effects across diverse settings and also the size of negative vaccine effects, e.g. from serotype substitution.},

abstract = {In 2003, France was the first European country to recommend 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) for a large proportion of healthy children. With complicated recommendations, the vaccine coverage during the first 4 y of implementation was low, then progressively increased to reach 90{\%} in 2008. The aim of this review was to describe the particular impact of PCVs in a country where the vaccine coverage was initially suboptimal. After PCV7 implementation, the PCV7 serotypes nearly disappeared among pneumococci isolated from meningitis (-73{\%}), other invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD; -90{\%}) and pneumococcal carriage (-97{\%}). Consequently, the rates of penicillin-resistant strains declined. However, because of important serotype replacement, the global effect on the incidence of meningitis (-31{\%}) or other IPD (-14{\%}) was modest and observed only in young children {\textless} 2 y old. After PCV13 transition, with immediate high vaccine coverage, the vaccine had an important impact on all pneumococcal disease: reduction of -20{\%} for pneumococcal meningitis, -36{\%} for non-meningitis IPD, -32{\%} for community acquired pneumonia and -15{\%} for S. pneumoniae carriage. These findings underline the complexity of pneumococcal epidemiology and the importance of high and fast vaccination coverage to obtain the optimal effect of PCVs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence were evaluated after 7 years of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) use in US children. METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed IPD cases were identified during 1998-2007 by 8 active population-based surveillance sites. We compared overall, age group-specific, syndrome-specific, and serotype group-specific IPD incidence in 2007 with that in 1998-1999 (before PCV7) and assessed potential serotype coverage of new conjugate vaccine formulations. RESULTS: Overall and PCV7-type IPD incidence declined by 45{\%} (from 24.4 to 13.5 cases per 100,000 population) and 94{\%} (from 15.5 to 1.0 cases per 100,000 population), respectively (P{\textless} .01 all age groups). The incidence of IPD caused by serotype 19A and other non-PCV7 types increased from 0.8 to 2.7 cases per 100,000 population and from 6.1 to 7.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively (P{\textless} .01 for all age groups). The rates of meningitis and invasive pneumonia caused by non-PCV7 types increased for all age groups (P{\textless} .05), whereas the rates of primary bacteremia caused by these serotypes did not change. In 2006-2007, PCV7 types caused 2{\%} of IPD cases, and the 6 additional serotypes included in an investigational 13-valent conjugate vaccine caused 63{\%} of IPD cases among children {\textless}5 years-old. CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic reductions in IPD after PCV7 introduction in the United States remain evident 7 years later.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical and public health importance of pneumococcal infections justifies the implementation of measures capable of reducing their incidence and severity, and explains why the recently marketed heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) has been widely studied by pediatricians. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of PCV-7 administered at 3, 5 and 11 months of age on respiratory tract infections in very young children.

METHODS: A total of 1,571 healthy infants (910 males) aged 75-105 days (median 82 days) were enrolled in this prospective cohort trial to receive a hexavalent vaccine (DTaP/IPV/HBV/Hib) and PCV-7 (n = 819) or the hexavalent vaccine alone (n = 752) at 3, 5 and 11 months of age. Morbidity was recorded for the 24 months following the second dose by monthly telephone interviews conducted by investigators blinded to the study treatment assignment using standardised questionnaires. During these interviews, the caregivers and the children's pediatricians were questioned about illnesses and the use of antibiotics since the previous telephone call. All of the data were analysed using SAS Windows v.12.

RESULTS: Among the 1,555 subjects (98.9{\%}) who completed the study, analysis of the data by the periods of follow-up demonstrated that radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was significantly less frequent in the PCV-7 group during the follow-up as a whole and during the last period of follow-up. Moreover, there were statistically significant between-group differences in the incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in each half-year period of follow-up except the first, with significantly lower number of episodes in children receiving PCV-7 than in controls. Furthermore, the antibiotic prescription data showed that the probability of receiving an antibiotic course was significantly lower in the PCV-7 group than in the control group.

CONCLUSION: Our findings show the effectiveness of the simplified PCV-7 schedule (three doses administered at 3, 5 and 11-12 months of age) in the prevention of CAP and AOM, diseases in which Streptococcus pneumoniae plays a major etiological role. A further benefit is that the use of PCV-7 reduces the number of antibiotic prescriptions. All of these advantages may also be important from an economic point of view.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Many European countries have engaged in awareness campaigns to decrease outpatient antibiotic use and several measures have been proposed, e.g. the number of defined daily doses (DDDs) or packages per 1000 inhabitants per day, producing conflicting findings. Therefore, we set out to explore what measure is most appropriate. METHODS Outpatient data on each dispensed and reimbursed medicinal package in Belgium between 2002 and 2009 were aggregated at the level of the active substance in accordance with the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification and expressed as the numbers of DDDs (WHO, version 2010), packages, treatments and insured individuals per 1000 inhabitants, insured individuals and patient contacts, per day, and in July-June years. Using these measures, time trends of outpatient antibiotic use were compared and explored in detail. RESULTS Expressed per 1000 inhabitants per day, outpatient antibiotic use increased between 2002-03 and 2008-09 in DDDs, whereas in packages, treatments and insured individuals it decreased. The same was true for use expressed per 1000 insured individuals or when allowing for the decreasing number of patient contacts. Increasing numbers of DDDs per package (more items per package and higher doses per unit for amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav) explain these discrepancies. CONCLUSIONS The number of packages is a more appropriate measure than the number of DDDs when assessing outpatient antibiotic use over time and the impact of awareness campaigns in countries dispensing 'complete packages'. We recommended the use of different complementary measures or caution when interpreting trends based only on DDDs.},

Prescribed packages per 1000 inhabitants was used as the unit of measure instead of the WHO recommended defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants. This was done primarily because DDD is an inaffective measure for a pediatric population.Several studies have found PPI to be a valid unit of measurement for this purpose.},

abstract = {Pneumococcal disease remains a significant cause of morbidity among young children. A large-scale efficacy trial in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente system (the KP trial) demonstrated that a seven-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV) is safe and immunogenic in young children and effective in preventing both invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes (97.4{\%} efficacy) and episodes of otitis media (7.0{\%} efficacy). Since the publication of the results of the KP trial in 2000, we have performed an additional analysis on the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the vaccine in low birth weight (LBW) and preterm (PT) infants, and have examined the efficacy of the vaccine during 1 year of wide-scale post-licensure use. The vaccine was at least as immunogenic in LBW and PT infants as in normal-weight, full-term infants and was 100{\%} effective, although the LBW and PT infants had higher rates of adverse events such as redness and swelling. LBW and PT infants receiving pneumococcal vaccine also had higher rates of adverse events, such as hives, than those receiving control meningococcal vaccine, but these reactions were not severe. When the PCV was used in the general population, the efficacy remained high and there was no corresponding increase in disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes. There was also evidence that vaccine administration led to herd immunity. Febrile illness was the only adverse event seen more frequently after vaccine administration than during a control period. CONCLUSION: the seven-valent conjugate vaccine is safe and effective for use in the general population.},

abstract = {Background: Pneumococcal disease burden is difficult to quantify due to limited data regarding non-bacteremic disease. We assessed serotype-specific differences in pneumococcal disease presentations in adults in Toronto, Canada. Methods: From 2003 to 2011, population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease was conducted and respiratory pneumococcal isolates collected in Metropolitan Toronto/Peel Region, Canada. Episodes of care were classified into disease categories. Results: Of 3105 eligible cases of IPD, 2060 cases were bacteremic pneumonia, and 1045 bacteremia without pneumonia. Of 2751 eligible respiratory cases, 1542 (56.0{\%}) were non-bacteremic pneumonia (NBPP), 467 (17.0{\%}) were other acute respiratory infection (oARI), and 742 (27.0{\%}) were isolates representing colonization. Serotypes 3 (11.3{\%}), 19A (8.4{\%}) and 22F (6.2{\%}) were the most common; serotypes 1,5, and 8 were rare. Serotypes 4, 14, 7F, 9V, 12F, 14, 19A and 6C were over-represented in bacteremic disease, and serotypes 3, 6A, 11A, 19F, 23A, 23F, 35B, 35F were more common in NBPP. The proportion of cases due to PCV7 serotypes declined from 48.7{\%} to 8.7{\%} in bacteremic pneumonia, from 35.3{\%} to 10.9{\%} in NBPP, from 34.2{\%} to 7.5{\%} in oARI, and from 38.7{\%} to 12.2{\%} in colonizing isolates. In 2010-2011, PCV13 serotypes accounted for 62.6{\%} of isolates associated with bacteremic pneumonia, 42.0{\%} of bacteremia without pneumonia, 41.1{\%} of NBPP, 25.7{\%} of oARI, and 32.9{\%} of colonizing isolates. Conclusions: Serotype distributions differ significantly in different presentations of pneumococcal disease. Herd protection due to PCV7 has changed serotype distribution, but PCV13 serotypes remain important in all categories of disease.},

abstract = {Framed in a study on the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies regarding children with meningeal signs, this study evaluated the quality weights for permanent sequelae after childhood bacterial meningitis obtained with two different classification instruments: the EQ-5D, and Health Utilities Index (HUI). A panel of 28 pediatricians classified seven standardized descriptions of patients with permanent sequelae after bacterial meningitis according to the EQ-5D and HUI classification system. Quality weights for each classification were calculated using the EQ-5D and HUI standard scoring algorithms. HUI Mark 3 quality weights were substantially lower than the EQ-5D for all descriptions (mean difference 0.11; 95{\%} CI: 0.08–0.14). Mean Kendall W for agreement of the ranking order between EQ-5D and HUI Mark 3 was 0.90. The EQ-5D and HUI resulted in different absolute quality weights, in particular for states associated with “deafness” and “mental retardation.” Due to their performance differences, the HUI may be preferable to EQ-5D in studies focussed on “sensation” (hearing, vision, speech) or “cognition.” These differences proved not to be relevant in the present cost-utility study of diagnostic strategies to rule out bacterial meningitis, as such consequences were at the distal end of the decision tree. This may be different in a cost-utility analysis of therapeutic strategies. Hence, sensitivity analysis to quality weights is recommended.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2007, the American Heart Association (AHA) published revised guidelines for infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis. Population-based data with respect to the potential impact of these revised guidelines are lacking. METHODS: The Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was used to identify all hospitalizations between April 2002 and March 2013 having IE as a primary diagnosis. Hospitalization rates were determined using age-specific population data from Statistics Canada. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate changes in the slope of hospitalization rates after the AHA guidelines were published. RESULTS: There were 9431 hospitalizations during the study period among 8055 patients (63{\%} male patients). Time trend analysis showed an increase of 0.05 IE hospitalizations per 10 million population per month (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.005-0.09; P = 0.029) from April 2002-March 2007 and an increase of 0.07 IE hospitalizations per 10 million population per month from April 2007-March 2013 (interaction P = 0.5213). Change-point analysis showed that a change in the slope occurred in April 2011, 4 years after publication of the revised AHA guidelines. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly reported organism (29.4{\%}). Streptococcal infections decreased over time, beginning before the 2007 guidelines (P {\textless} 0.0001). The presence of a pacemaker or defibrillator was an increasingly prevalent risk factor over time (4{\%} increase per year; P = 0.0178). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of IE hospitalizations increased in Canada before and after the publication of the 2007 AHA guidelines, with no significant change in slope after 2007. These guidelines had no impact on the incidence of IE hospitalizations.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial stewardship is recognized as a key component to stop the current European spread of antimicrobial resistance. It has also become evident that antimicrobial resistance is a problem that cannot be tackled by single institutions or physicians. Prevention of antimicrobial resistance needs rigorous actions at ward level, institution level, national level and at supra-national levels. Countries can learn from each other and possibly transplant best practices across borders to prevent antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study is to highlight some of the success stories of proven cost-effective interventions, and to describe the actions that have been taken, the outcomes that have been found, and the difficulties that have been met. In some cases we came across substantial scope for real-life cost savings. Although the best approach to effectively hinder the spread of antimicrobial resistance remains unclear and may vary significantly among settings, several EU-wide examples demonstrate that cost-effective antimicrobial stewardship is possible. Such examples can encourage others to implement (the most cost-effective) elements in their system.},

abstract = {Objectives To complement analyses of the linear trend and seasonal fluctuation of European outpatient antibiotic use expressed in defined daily doses (DDD) by analyses of data in packages, to assess the agreement between both measures and to study changes in the number of DDD per package over time.Methods Data on outpatient antibiotic use, aggregated at the level of the active substance (WHO version 2011) were collected from 2000 to 2007 for 31 countries and expressed in DDD and packages per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID and PID, respectively). Data expressed in DID and PID were analysed separately using non-linear mixed models while the agreement between these measurements was analysed through a joint non-linear mixed model. The change in DDD per package over time was studied with a linear mixed model.Results Total outpatient antibiotic and penicillin use in Europe and their seasonal fluctuation significantly increased in DID, but not in PID. The use of combinations of penicillins significantly increased in DID and in PID. Broad-spectrum penicillin use did not increase significantly in DID and decreased significantly in PID. For all but one subgroup, country-specific deviations moved in the same direction whether measured in DID or PID. The correlations are not perfect. The DDD per package increased significantly over time for all but one subgroup.Conclusions Outpatient antibiotic use in Europe shows contrasting trends, depending on whether DID or PID is used as the measure. The increase of the DDD per package corroborates the recommendation to adopt PID to monitor outpatient antibiotic use in Europe.},

Methods: The integrated TRIVAC vaccine cost-effectiveness model from the Pan American Health Organization's ProVac Initiative (version 2.0) was applied from the perspective of the Government of Peru. Twenty successive cohorts of children from birth to 5 years were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were pneumococcal pneumonia (PP), pneumococcal meningitis (PM), pneumococcal sepsis (PS) and acute otitis media from any causes (AOM). Measures included prevention of cases, neurological sequelae (NS), auditory sequelae (AS), deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs). A sensitivity analyses was also performed. Findings: For the 20 cohorts, net costs with PCV10 and PCV13 were US{\$} 363.26 million and US{\$} 408.26 million, respectively. PCV10 prevented 570,273 AOM; 79,937 PP; 2217 PM; 3049 PS; 282 NS; 173 AS; and 7512 deaths. PCV13 prevented 419,815 AOM; 112,331 PN; 3116 PM; 4285 PS; 404 NS; 248 AS; and 10,386 deaths. Avoided DALYs were 226,370 with PCV10 and 313,119 with PCV13. Saved treatment costs were US{\$} 37.39 million with PCV10 and US{\$} 47.22 million with PCV13. Costs per DALY averted were US{\$} 1605 for PCV10, and US{\$} 1304 for PCV13. Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. PCV13 has an extended dominance over PCV10. Conclusion: Both pneumococcal vaccines are cost effective in the Peruvian context. Although the net cost of vaccination with PCV10 is lower, PCV13 prevented more deaths, pneumococcal complications and sequelae. Costs per each prevented DALY were lower with PCV13. Thus, PCV13 would be the preferred policy; PCV10 would also be reasonable (and cost-saving relative to the status quo) if for some reason 13-valent were not feasible.},

Infants (N = 780) received either PHiD-CV or 7vCRM (2:1) at 2, 3, 4, and 11-13 months of age. Nasopharyngeal samples taken at 5, 11, 14, 18, and 24 months of age were cultured to detect Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Polymerase chain reaction assays quantified H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae and confirmed H. influenzae as nontypeable (NTHi). Primary outcome measure was vaccine efficacy (VE) against NTHi colonization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In both groups, NTHi colonization increased with age from 33{\%} in 5-month-olds to 65{\%} in 24-month-olds. Three months postbooster, VE against colonization was 0.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -21.8{\%} to 18.4{\%}) and VE against acquisition 10.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, -31.3{\%} to 38.9{\%}). At each sampling moment, no differences between groups in either NTHi prevalence or H. influenzae density were detected. Streptococcus pneumoniae (range, 39{\%}-57{\%}), M. catarrhalis (range, 63{\%}--69{\%}), and S. aureus (range, 9{\%}-30{\%}) colonization patterns were similar between groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PHiD-CV had no differential effect on nasopharyngeal NTHi colonization or H. influenzae density in healthy Dutch children up to 2 years of age, implying that herd effects for NTHi are not to be expected.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the complex interaction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and individual classes of antimicrobial agents on the nasopharyngeal carriage of erythromycin-resistant pneumococci within the day-care center population. Between February 2005 and May 2007, nasopharyngeal cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained from 1,829 day-care center attendees in Central Greece. Thirty-one percent of the pneumococci were erythromycin-resistant; 85.2{\%} of these isolates were also penicillin-nonsusceptible. PCV7 immunization was associated with decreased carriage of erythromycin-resistant PCV7 serotypes but not with an overall decrease in erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae colonization. The largest decline in the carriage of erythromycin-resistant pneumococci, particularly of PCV7 serotypes, was observed among vaccinated attendees who had not been exposed to antimicrobials within the preceding 3 months. Exposure to macrolides, 90{\%} clarithromycin, significantly correlated with erythromycin resistance (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.08, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.38-3.12). There was a trend toward an association between the use of oral cephalosporins, other than cefprozil and cefaclor, and colonization with erythromycin-resistant pneumococci (AOR = 1.91, 95{\%} CI = 0.92-3.96). Penicillins had a nonsignificant correlation with the carriage of erythromycin-resistant pneumococci (AOR = 1.17, 95{\%} CI = 0.80-1.71). Despite the widespread PCV7 immunization, the antibiotic pressure, particularly of macrolides, continues to cause dissemination of erythromycin-resistant, commonly multidrug-resistant, pneumococci within the day-care center population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The relative invasiveness rates (attack rates) of Streptococcus pneumoniae of different capsular serotypes in children are not known. Estimates of capsular serotype invasiveness (designated "invasive odds ratios") that are based on cross-sectional prevalence carriage data have been published, but these estimates could be biased by variation in the duration of carriage. METHODS The relative attack rates of invasive pneumococci were measured using national UK surveillance data on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence and data on incidence of pneumococcal acquisition from longitudinal studies of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage. RESULTS We found significant differences in capsular serotype-specific attack rates. For example, capsular serotypes 4, 14, 7F, 9V, and 18C were associated with rates of {\textgreater}20 IPD cases/100,000 acquisitions, whereas capsular serotypes 23F, 6A, 19F, 16F, 6B, and 15B/C were associated with {\textless}10 IPD cases/100,000 acquisitions. There was an inverse relationship between duration of carriage and attack rate by capsular serotype (P{\textless}.0001). Attack rates were significantly correlated with invasive odds ratios (P{\textless}.0001). CONCLUSIONS The capsular serotype is a major determinant of both pneumococcal duration of carriage and attack rate. Published invasive odds ratios are a reliable and practical method of determining capsular serotype invasiveness and will be valuable for investigating and characterizing emerging capsular serotypes in the context of conjugate vaccination.},
annote = {Sleeman et al used longitudinally collected data from 313 infants in Oxfordshire to measure acquisition and duration of carriage of pneumococcal serotypes and compared this to data on active IPD surveillance running concurrently in England and Wales. Using this comparison they were able to estimate capsilar specific attack rates, i.e. the incidence of IPD per 100.000 individuals divided by the nasopharyngeal acquisition of carriage per 100.000 individuals. 


Sleeman et al used longitudinally collected data from 313 infants in Oxfordshire to measure acquisition and duration of carriage of pneumococcal serotypes. They followed two cohorts of children. In the first study they followed 100 children 24 months between 1996 - 1999 and took nasopharyngeal swabs at 4 - 96 weeks of age. A total of 1353 of 1500 planned visits took place. In study 2 a birth cohort of 213 children were followed for 24 weeks in 1999 and 2001. Nasopharyngeal swabs were conducted at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of age. A total of 1907 of 1917 visits took place. By 6 months of age, 54{\%} of infants had acquired pneumococci at least once. By 2 years of age 97{\%} of infants had aquired carriage.

abstract = {Background Although China has a high burden of pneumococcal disease among young children, the government does not administer publicly-funded pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) through its Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of publicly-funded PCV-7, PCV-10, and PCV-13 vaccination programs for infants in China. Methods Using a Markov model, we simulated a cohort of 16 million Chinese infants to estimate the impact of PCV-7, PCV-10, and PCV-13 vaccination programs from a societal perspective. We extrapolated health states to estimate the effects of the programs over the course of a lifetime of 75 years. Parameters in the model were derived from a review of the literature. Results We found that PCV-7, PCV-10, and PCV-13 vaccination programs would be cost-effective compared to no vaccination. However, PCV-13 had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({\$}11,464/QALY vs {\$}16,664/QALY for PCV-10 and {\$}18,224/QALY for PCV-7) due to a reduction in overall costs. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to the utility of acute otitis media, the cost of PCV-13, and the incidence of pneumonia and acute otitis media. Conclusions The Chinese government should take steps to reduce the burden of pneumococcal diseases among young children through the inclusion of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in its EPI. Although all vaccinations would be cost-effective, PCV-13 would save more costs to the healthcare system and would be the preferred strategy.},

abstract = {AIM: To establish whether universal vaccination of infants with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is likely to be cost-effective from the perspective of the health care provider (NHS). METHOD: Two hypothetical cohorts--one vaccinated and one unvaccinated--were followed over their lifetime, and the expected net costs and benefits (measured in terms of life-years and quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained) were compared in the two cohorts. The impact of indirect effects of the vaccine, such as herd immunity and serotype replacement, were investigated and their relative importance was assessed by performing univariate sensitivity analysis and multivariate Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions (no herd immunity and no serotype replacement) the programme is not expected to be cost-effective from the NHS perspective at the current price of the vaccine (assumed 30 pounds per dose, three-dose programme). A reduction of the cost of the vaccine to half of its current level could bring the cost per QALY gained within normally acceptable ranges. If the burden of disease is significantly underestimated by current surveillance systems, then the cost per QALY gained approaches acceptable levels at the current vaccine price. Herd immunity may substantially reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease, particularly of pneumonia among the elderly, leading to a significant improvement in the cost per life year and QALY gained. Serotype replacement would partly offset these benefits, although only with a complete substitution of vaccine types with non-vaccine types and a low level of herd immunity, would pneumococcal vaccination programme would not be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are sensitive to assumptions regarding the current burden of pneumococcal disease and the future impact that vaccination will have in the unvaccinated and on the future serotype distribution. This study quantifies, for the first time, how these indirect effects may change the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are frequently obtained in the emergency department (ED) evaluation of children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of bacteremia in children presenting to the ED with CAP, identify subgroups at increased risk for bacteremia, and quantify the effect of positive blood cultures on management.

METHODS: This case-control study was nested within a cohort of children followed up at 35 pediatric practices. Patients from this cohort who were ≤18 years of age, evaluated in the ED in 2006-2007, and diagnosed with CAP were eligible. Cases were those with bacteremia. Controls included those with negative blood cultures and those without blood cultures performed.

RESULTS: A total of 877 (9.6{\%}) of 9099 children with CAP were evaluated in the ED. The mean age was 3.6 years; 53{\%} were male. Blood cultures were obtained from 291 children (33.2{\%}). Overall, the prevalence of bacteremia was 2.1{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.8{\%}-4.4{\%}). Bacteremia occurred in 2.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.0{\%}-5.6{\%}) with an infiltrate on chest radiograph and in 13.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.8{\%}-33.6{\%}) with complicated pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 4 of the 6 cases of bacteremia. Blood culture results altered management in 5 of the 6 bacteremic patients; 1 had an appropriate broadening and 4 had an appropriate narrowing of coverage. The contamination rate was 1.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.2{\%}-3.0{\%}).

CONCLUSION: Children presenting to the ED for evaluation of CAP are at low-risk for bacteremia. Although positive blood cultures frequently altered clinical management, the overall impact was small because of the low prevalence of bacteremia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study compared parental adherence to delayed antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media with and without a written prescription in a pediatric emergency department. PATIENTS AND METHODS Children aged 2 to 12 years who met criteria for delayed antibiotic treatment were randomly assigned to observation therapy with or without a prescription. Patients randomly assigned to observation therapy without prescription were instructed to seek follow-up care if symptoms persisted for 2 to 3 days. Patients assigned to observation therapy with a prescription were discharged with an antibiotic prescription, and instructed to fill it if their child's symptoms persisted 2 to 3 days. A research assistant who was blinded to group assignment called parents 7 to 10 days after the visit to assess adherence to observation therapy. RESULTS Of 117 children assigned to the observation therapy group, 100 completed follow-up; of 115 assigned to the observation therapy with a prescription group, 106 completed follow-up. In the observation therapy group, 87 parents reported no antibiotic use within the 3-day observation period compared with 66 parents in the prescription group. During the entire study period, 81{\%} of the observation therapy group reported no use of antibiotics compared with 53{\%} in the prescription group. These groups did not differ in satisfaction with the visit; 91{\%} and 95{\%} were very or extremely satisfied, respectively. No complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS Observation therapy with and without a prescription were both well accepted by parents of children diagnosed with acute otitis media in an urban pediatric emergency department. Adherence to delayed antibiotic therapy was better for those not offered a prescription. These data suggest that, in the pediatric emergency department setting, observation therapy reduces antibiotic use without compromising satisfaction with the visit.},

SETTING All Canadian provinces between May and June 2008. PARTICIPANTS Caregivers of 1 or more children aged 6 months to 5 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Caregivers' reports on the number of AOM episodes experienced by the child in the past 12 months, as well as disease characteristics, health services and medication use, time spent on medical consultations (including travel), and time taken off from work to care for the sick children. RESULTS A total of 502 eligible caregivers were recruited, 161 (32{\%}) of whom reported at least 1 AOM episode for their children and 42 (8{\%}) of whom reported 3 or more episodes during the past 12 months. Most children (94{\%}, 151 of 161) visited with health professionals during their most recent AOM episodes. The average time required for medical examination was 3.1 hours in an emergency department and 1.8 hours in an outpatient clinic. Overall, 93{\%} of episodes resulted in antibiotics use. A substantial proportion of caregivers (38{\%}) missed work during this time; the average time taken off work was 15.9 hours. CONCLUSION In Canada, episodes of AOM are still associated with substantial use of health services and indirect costs to the caregivers.},

METHODS We conducted an epidemiological, prospective, observational, multi-centre cohort study (NCT01365390) in five East European countries (Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovenia) between June 2011 and January 2013 to determine the incidence and clinical characteristics of AOM among children aged {\textless} 6 years during 1 year. RESULTS AOM incidence was 160.7 cases (95 {\%} confidence interval [CI]: 144.7-177.9) per 1000 person-years (PY) being the lowest in the {\textless} 1 year age group (92.3 cases [95 {\%} CI: 59.7-136.2] per 1000 PY) and the highest in the 3- {\textless} 4 years age group (208.9 cases [95 {\%} CI: 165.1-260.7] per 1000 PY). AOM incidence was similar across the countries, with the exception of Slovenia (340.3 cases [95 {\%} CI: 278.3-412.0] per 1000 PY). There was a lower risk in breastfed children and a higher risk in those attending school/childcare or with allergies. AOM required 521 visits to the doctor.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) vaccine trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of a pneumococcal vaccine containing ten serotype-specific polysaccharides conjugated to Haemophilus influenzae protein D, tetanus toxoid, and diphtheria toxoid as the carrier proteins (PHiD-CV10) against invasive pneumococcal disease. METHODS: In this cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, children aged younger than 19 months received PHiD-CV10 in 52 clusters or hepatitis vaccines as control in 26 clusters. Infants aged younger than 7 months at the first vaccination received either a 3+1 or a 2+1 vaccination schedule, children aged 7-11 months received a 2+1 schedule, and those 12-18 months of age received a two-dose schedule. The primary and secondary objectives were to assess vaccine effectiveness against culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease due to any of the ten vaccine serotypes for the 3+1 and 2+1 schedules, respectively, in children who received at least one PHiD-CV10 dose before 7 months of age. Masked follow-up of pneumococcal disease lasted from the first vaccination (from February, 2009, to October, 2010) to January 31, 2012. Invasive disease data were retrieved from data accumulated in the national infectious diseases register. This trial and the nested acute otitis media trial are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00861380 and NCT00839254, respectively. FINDINGS: 47,369 children were enrolled from February, 2009, to October, 2010. 30,528 participants were assessed for the primary objective. 13 culture-confirmed vaccine-type cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were detected: none in the PHiD-CV10 3+1 group, one in the PHiD-CV10 2+1 group, and 12 in the control groups. The estimates for vaccine effectiveness were 100{\%} (95{\%} CI 83-100) for PHiD-CV10 3+1 and 92{\%} (58-100) for PHiD-CV10 2+1 groups. Two cases of any culture-confirmed invasive disease irrespective of serotype were detected in combined PHiD-CV10 infant cohorts compared with 14 in the corresponding control cohorts (vaccine effectiveness 93{\%}, 75-99). In catch-up cohorts, seven cases of invasive disease were reported, all in the control group: two cases in the children enrolled at 7-11 months of age; and five cases in children enrolled at 12-18 months of age (vaccine effectiveness 100{\%}, 79-100). Non-fatal serious adverse events suspected to be vaccine-related were reported via routine post-immunisation safety surveillance in 18 children. INTERPRETATION: This nationwide trial showed high PHiD-CV10 effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease when given in different schedules. For the first time, effectiveness of a 2+1 schedule in infants was confirmed in a clinical trial. FUND1. Palmu AA, Jokinen J, Borys D, et al.

abstract = {Objective. The 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics acute otitis media guidelines urge parents to weigh the benefits of reduced antibiotic use, adverse drug events, and future resistance versus risks of extra costs and sick days resulting from guideline use. The value of decreased antibiotic resistance has not been quantified. The objective was to perform cost-utility analysis, estimating the resistance value of implementing the guidelines for acute otitis media treatment for children {\textless}2 years of age. Outcomes were described with a common denominator and the value of avoiding resistance was estimated using a parental perspective. Methods. Decision analysis results were used for outcome probabilities. Published utilities were used to describe outcomes in quality-adjusted life-day units. The minimum resistance benefit value, where the benefits of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines would at least balance their costs, was defined as the guidelines' incremental costs minus their other benefits. Results. For a child 2 to {\textless}6 months of age presenting to a primary care physician with possible otitis media, parents would need to value the resistance benefit at 0.77 quality-adjusted life-days per antibiotic prescription avoided for the guidelines' benefits to balance their costs. For the 6- to {\textless}24-month-old group, results were 0.67 quality-adjusted life-days per prescription avoided. Results were sensitive to the dollar cost utility;when willingness to pay ranged from {\$}20 000 to {\$}200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, results ranged from 0.36 and 0.30 quality-adjusted life- days up to 4.10 and 3.57 quality-adjusted life-days for the 2- to {\textless}6-month-old and 6- to {\textless}24-month-old groups, respectively. Costs were driven by missed parent work days. Conclusions. From a societal perspective, trading 0.30 to 4 quality-adjusted life-days to avoid 1 antibiotic course might be desirable; from a parental perspective, this may not be as desirable. Parent demand for antibiotics may be rational when driven by the value of parent time. Other approaches that have the potential to reduce antibiotic use, such as wider use of influenza vaccine and improved rapid viral diagnostic techniques, might be more successful.

@article{Madhi2013a,
abstract = {Background: The immunogenicity of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has not been evaluated in HIV-infected infants following the first and second PCV-doses. We studied antibody kinetics of serotypes included in 7-valent PCV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected infants prior to and following each of three PCV-doses. Methods: HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-uninfected (HUU) and HIV-infected mothers (HEU); and perinatal HIV-infected children with CD4+{\textless}25{\%} randomized to initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART) when clinically and/or immunologically indicated (ART-) or immediately (ART+) were enrolled. Vaccination occurred at approximately 7.4, 11.5 and 15.5 weeks of age. Serotype-specific antibody was measured by ELISA following each PCV-dose and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) to three serotypes following the second and third doses. Results: Pre-vaccination, antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were higher in HUU compared to HIV-exposed groups for most serotypes. GMCs and proportion of infants with antibody ≥0.35 $\mu$g/ml were similar in HUU compared to other groups following the second PCV-dose. In all groups, GMCs were greater following the third compared to post-second dose; and a higher proportion within each group had antibody ≥0.35 $\mu$g/ml to 6B and 23F. OPA GMTs increased after the third compared to post-second dose for studied-serotypes; as did the proportion with OPA ≥8 to 23F. Conclusion: A two-dose primary-series of PCV probably confers similar protection against invasive pneumococcal disease in HIV-infected compared to HUU children. The inferior response to serotypes 6B and 23F, and lower GMCs and OPA GMTs, following two compared to after three PCV-doses may have implications in the prevention of pneumococcal disease in high-burden countries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. Since most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, only children with persistent middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss potentially require treatment. Previous Cochrane reviews have focused on the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion, adenoidectomy, nasal autoinflation, antihistamines, decongestants and corticosteroids in OME. This review, focusing on the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with OME, is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2012. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotics in children up to 18 years with OME. SEARCH METHODS The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 3); PubMed; Ovid EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 April 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics with placebo, no treatment or therapy of unproven effectiveness in children with OME. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS Twenty-five trials (3663 children) were eligible for inclusion. Two trials did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 trials (3258 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points for evaluation. Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias.We found moderate quality evidence (six trials including 484 children) that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have complete resolution at two to three months post-randomisation (primary outcome) than those allocated to the control treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 2.53; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 5). However, there is evidence (albeit of low quality; five trials, 742 children) indicating that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash (primary outcome) than those allocated to control treatment (RR 2.15, 95{\%} CI 1.29 to 3.60; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 20).In respect of the secondary outcome of complete resolution at any time point, we found low to moderate quality evidence from five meta-analyses, including between two and 14 trials, of a beneficial effect of antibiotics, with a NNTB ranging from 3 to 7. Time periods ranged from 10 to 14 days to six months.In terms of other secondary outcomes, only two trials (849 children) reported on hearing levels at two to four weeks and found conflicting results. None of the trials reported data on speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with a decrease in the rate of ventilation tube insertion (two trials, 121 children) or in tympanic membrane sequelae (one trial, 103 children), while low quality evidence indicated that children treated with antibiotics were less likely to have acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks (five trials, 1086 children; NNTB 18) and within six months post-randomisation (two trials, 199 children; NNTB 5). It should, however, be noted that the beneficial effect of oral antibiotics on acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks was no longer significant when we excluded studies with high risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review presents evidence of both benefits and harms associated with the use of oral antibiotics to treat children up to 16 years with OME. Although evidence indicates that oral antibiotics are associated with an increased chance of complete resolution of OME at various time points, we also found evidence that these children are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash. The impact of antibiotics on short-term hearing is uncertain and low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube insertions. Furthermore, we found no data on the impact of antibiotics on other important outcomes such as speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life.Even in situations where clear and relevant benefits of oral antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must always be carefully balanced against adverse effects and the emergence of bacterial resistance. This has specifically been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.},

@article{Charlson1987,
abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12{\%} (181); "1-2", 26{\%} (225); "3-4", 52{\%} (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85{\%} (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8{\%} (588); "1", 25{\%} (54); "2", 48{\%} (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59{\%} (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

@article{Geno2015b,
abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is an important human pathogen. Its virulence is largely due to its polysaccharide capsule, which shields it from the host immune system, and because of this, the capsule has been extensively studied. Studies of the capsule led to the identification of DNA as the genetic material, identification of many different capsular serotypes, and identification of the serotype-specific nature of protection by adaptive immunity. Recent studies have led to the determination of capsular polysaccharide structures for many serotypes using advanced analytical technologies, complete elucidation of genetic basis for the capsular types, and the development of highly effective pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Conjugate vaccine use has altered the serotype distribution by either serotype replacement or switching, and this has increased the need to serotype pneumococci. Due to great advances in molecular technologies and our understanding of the pneumococcal genome, molecular approaches have become powerful tools to predict pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, more-precise and -efficient serotyping methods that directly detect polysaccharide structures are emerging. These improvements in our capabilities will greatly enhance future investigations of pneumococcal epidemiology and diseases and the biology of colonization and innate immunity to pneumococcal capsules.},

abstract = {The rise of antimicrobial resistance in many pathogens presents a major challenge to the treatment and control of infectious diseases. Furthermore, the observation that drug-resistant strains have risen to substantial prevalence but have not replaced drug-susceptible strains despite continuing (and even growing) selective pressure by antimicrobial use presents an important problem for those who study the dynamics of infectious diseases. While simple competition models predict the exclusion of one strain in favour of whichever is 'fitter', or has a higher reproduction number, we argue that in the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae there has been persistent coexistence of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, with neither approaching 100 per cent prevalence. We have previously proposed that models seeking to understand the origins of coexistence should not incorporate implicit mechanisms that build in stable coexistence 'for free'. Here, we construct a series of such 'structurally neutral' models that incorporate various features of bacterial spread and host heterogeneity that have been proposed as mechanisms that may promote coexistence. We ask to what extent coexistence is a typical outcome in each. We find that while coexistence is possible in each of the models we consider, it is relatively rare, with two exceptions: (i) allowing simultaneous dual transmission of sensitive and resistant strains lets coexistence become a typical outcome, as does (ii) modelling each strain as competing more strongly with itself than with the other strain, i.e. self-immunity greater than cross-immunity. We conclude that while treatment and contact heterogeneity can promote coexistence to some extent, the in-host interactions between strains, particularly the interplay between coinfection, multiple infection and immunity, play a crucial role in the long-term population dynamics of pathogens with drug resistance.},

abstract = {The use of 16S rRNA gene sequences to study bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy has been by far the most common housekeeping genetic marker used for a number of reasons. These reasons include (i) its presence in almost all bacteria often existing as a multigene family, or operons; (ii) the function of the 16S rRNA gener over time has not changed, suggesting that random sequence changes ara a more accurate measure of time (evolution); and (iii) the 16S rRNA gene (1.500 bp) is large enough for informatic purpose. In 1980 in the Approved lists, 1791 valid names were recognized at the rank of species. Today, this number has balloned to 8.168 species, a 456{\%} increase. The explosion in the number of recognized taxa is directly attributable to the ease in performance of 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies as opposed to the more cumbersome manipulations involving DNA-DNA hybridization investigations. DNA-DNA hybridization is unequivocally the "gold standard" for proposed new species and for the definitive assignment of a strain with ambiguous properties to the correct taxonomic unit. Based upon DNA-DNA reassociation kinetics, the genetic definition of a species is quantificable, i.e., (i) ca. {\textgreater}70{\%} DNA-DNA relatedness and (ii) 5°C or less deltaTm for the stability of heteroduplex molecules. },

Design: Observational retrospective population-based cohort study using hospital administrative data. Setting: All WA hospitals. Participants: A total of 53 673 children younger than 15 years who underwent surgery for MVTI in the period 1981-2004. Main Outcome Measures: Age-specific incidence rates and incidence rate ratios. Results: The rate of MVTI in children younger than 15 years peaked in 1997 at 6.7 per 1000 person-years and decreased to 5.6 per 1000 person-years by 2004. Based on 2004 rates, 8.4{\{}{\%}{\}} of WA children will undergo at least 1 MVTI procedure before reaching age 15 years. The rate of MVTI was 37{\{}{\%}{\}} lower in Indigenous children, and the procedures were performed at an older age compared with non-Indigenous children. Higher rates of MVTI were associated with areas of higher economic resources, lower education and occupation status, and living in metropolitan areas. Conclusions: The rate of MVTI in WA is showing evidence of a decline, even among children younger than 5 years. There remains an issue regarding equity of access to care for Indigenous children. Increasing parental economic resources may be associated with higher rates of MVTI independent of educational status. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}}2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

The calculation of the basic reproductive number (R0) depends on the assumptions made about the transmission within and between age groups through the structure of the WAIFW matrix and different structures might lead to different estimates for R0 and hence different estimates for the minimal immunization coverage needed for the elimination of the infection in the population. In this paper, we estimate R0 for varicella in Belgium. The force of infection is estimated from seroprevalence data using fractional polynomials and we show how the estimate of R0 is heavily influenced by the structure of the WAIFW matrix.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PncCRM, has been shown to prevent acute otitis media caused by vaccine serotypes and to reduce otitis surgery. Our aim was to assess long term efficacy of the vaccine on tympanostomy tube placements. METHODS: Children with complete follow-up in the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial up to 24 months of age and still living in the study area (1490 of 1662 randomized at 2 months of age) were invited to a single visit at 4-5 years of age. The children had been vaccinated at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age with PncCRM or hepatitis B vaccine (control). Tympanostomy tube placements reported by parents at the visit were verified from hospital and private medical center records. Additionally, tympanostomy tube placements of all children were verified from the hospital discharge registry. Vaccine efficacy (VE) was estimated by comparing all events of tympanostomy tube placement between vaccine groups. RESULTS: During the vaccine trial (2-24 months of age), VE (95{\%} confidence interval) in preventing tympanostomy tube placement was only 4{\%} (-19-23{\%}). Altogether 756 children were enrolled for the follow-up study. After 24 months of age, the rate of surgery was 3.5 per 100 person-years in the PncCRM and 5.7 per 100 person-years in the control children, giving VE of 39{\%} (4-61{\%}). In the hospital-based data of all children (N = 1490), VE of 44{\%} was obtained (19-62{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of PncCRM vaccine at infancy was associated with a reduction in tympanostomy tube placement from 2 to 4-5 years of age.},

PCV7 was introduced into the private sector in 2004, the national immunization programme in 2009 and was replaced by PCV13 in August 2011. The aim was to assess the impact of PCV7 introduction on the distribution of otopathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility both in prospectively observed vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children and in comparison to samples collected before vaccine introduction. Their main findings were that the overall proportion of culture positive episodes of AOM had decrease post PCV7 (53.3{\%} vs 44.7{\%}, P = 0.003) as well proportion of S. pnuemoniae positive episodes (27.7{\%} vs 19.1{\%}, P = 0.002). It is not clear wether comparison of species specific proportions were corrected for the overall decrease in proportions. No statistical difference in otopathogens was observed in prospectively evaluted vaccinated vs unvaccinated children although there was a trend towards a higher proportion of S. pneumoniae positive episodes in unvaccinated children and lower proportion of Haemophilus influenzae. The meager results of this study must be interpreted with caution as there was no description of how or why the retrospective samples had originaly been collected, and unclear wether the prospective samples were consecutively collected or a convenience sample. Both issues are critical to the study results. Furthermore, the interpretation is muddied by the skewed introduction of different vaccinations (2004, 2009 and 2012).},

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of an administrative database. SETTING Ambulatory visits in the United States. SUBJECTS AND METHODS National Ambulatory and Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, 2005-2010; univariate, multivariate, and stratified analyses of antibiotic usage were performed. The study population was restricted to children without acute or unspecified otitis media. The primary outcome was the probability of oral antibiotic administration when OME was diagnosed. The impact of the location of service and subspecialty care was also analyzed. RESULTS Data from 1,390,404,196 pediatric visits demonstrated that oral antibiotics were administered for 32{\%} of visits with an OME diagnosis, even in the absence of acute otitis media (odds ratio, 4.31; 95{\%} confidence interval: 2.88-6.44; P {\textless} .001). The highest antibiotic administration was seen in the emergency department (risk difference, 37.1{\%}; number needed to harm, 3). No significant increased risk of antibiotic usage was seen during otolaryngology visits. Diagnoses of infections at nonotologic sites were associated with a 1.98 to 26.60 increase in odds of oral antibiotic administration. CONCLUSION Oral antibiotics continue to be administered in children with OME in the absence of acute infection, with risk varying by location of service. There is a potential opportunity for quality improvement through reducing antibiotic administration for pediatric OME.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, an increasing trend in the incidence of pneumococcal disease in Europe has been reported. We investigated the effect of the use of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in an area of northern Spain, where all recorded cases of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) were included (n = 450; 91 between 1996-2007 in children aged {\textless}5 years and 359 between 1998-2007 in adults aged {\textgreater}64 years). All isolates were serotyped. In children, the overall IPD incidence did not significantly decrease after the introduction, in late 2001, of PCV7. However, the incidence of PCV7 serotypes significantly decreased by 137.2{\%} from 31.59 cases/100,000 population in 1996-2001 to 13.42 in 2002-2007 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] -27.2 to -342.4{\%}), as did the overall rates of penicillin resistance (from 45.6 to 18.6{\%}) and multiresistance (from 30.3 to 11{\%}). In older adults, the overall IPD incidence showed a non-significant increase due to non-PCV7 serotypes, which seemed to continue a previous trend in our region.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Bacterial meningitis is a serious and potentially rapid life-threatening disease. Therefore, to ensure appropriate treatment, early recognition of signs and symptoms is imperative, along with knowledge of the epidemiology and microbiology of the disease. METHODS A long-term, nationwide epidemiological study of bacterial causes of meningitis in children (≤ 18 y) in Iceland during the period 1975-2010 was carried out. A detailed chart review was performed of all cases diagnosed in 1995-2010. RESULTS A total of 477 children were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis during the period 1975-2010. Of these, 67{\%} were aged under 5 y. The most common pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (n = 265), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 132), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 47), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 19); their incidences varied according to age. The age-specific incidence (cases/100,000/y) dropped from 26 in 1975 to 1 in 2010 (p {\textless} 0.001). The most common symptoms during the period 1995-2010 were fever (92{\%}), vomiting (67{\%}), nuchal rigidity (60{\%}), and rashes/petechiae (51{\%}). H. influenzae type b disappeared following implementation of Hib vaccination in 1989, and, likewise, the incidence of meningococcal meningitis fell significantly after vaccination against meningococcus serogroup C was initiated in 2002 (p {\textless} 0.001). The overall 30-day case fatality rate of bacterial meningitis was 4.4{\%} and remained unchanged during the study period. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of childhood bacterial meningitis has been reduced significantly by successful vaccinations against H. influenzae type b and N. meningitidis serogroup C. Nevertheless, the case fatality rate has remained unchanged and thus the disease is still a serious threat to childhood health. Further prevention by novel vaccines and improved management of childhood meningitis is an exciting challenge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Day care centre (DCC) attendees play a central role in maintaining the circulation of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in the population. The prevalence of pneumococcal carriage is highest in DCC attendees but varies across countries and is found to be consistently lower in Finland than in Portugal. We compared key parameters underlying pneumococcal transmission in DCCs to understand which of these contributed to the observed differences in carriage prevalence. METHODS: Longitudinal data about serotype-specific carriage in DCC attendees in Portugal (47 children in three rooms; mean age 2 years; range 1--3 years) and Finland (91 children in seven rooms; mean age 4 years; range 1--7 years) were analysed with a continuous-time event history model in a Bayesian framework. The monthly rates of within-room transmission, community acquisition and clearing carriage were estimated. RESULTS: The posterior mean of within-room transmission rate was 1.05 per month (Portugal) vs. 0.63 per month (Finland). The smaller rate of clearance in Portugal (0.57 vs. 0.73 per month) is in accordance with the children being younger. The overall community rate of acquisition was larger in the Portuguese setting (0.25 vs. 0.11 per month), in agreement with that the groups belonged to a larger DCC. The model adequately predicted the observed levels of carriage prevalence and longitudinal patterns in carriage acquisition and clearance. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in prevalence of carriage (61{\%} in Portuguese vs. 26{\%} among Finnish DCC attendees) was assigned to the longer duration of carriage in younger attendees and a significantly higher rate of within-room transmission and community acquisition in the Portuguese setting.},

abstract = {Pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) is a surface-exposed common 37-kilodalton multi-functional lipoprotein detected on all known serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This lipoprotein belongs to the ABC-type transport protein complex that transports Mn(2+); it is also an adhesin that plays a major role in pneumococcal attachment to the host cell and virulence. PsaA is immunogenic and natural nasopharyngeal colonization of pneumococci elicits an increase in antibody towards PsaA. Hence, PsaA is being actively evaluated as a component of a vaccine in formulations composed of pneumococcal common proteins. PsaA has been expressed as an E. coli recombinant protein, purified, and evaluated in a phase one clinical trial. This article reviews PsaA, its structure and role in pneumococcal virulence, immunogenicity, and potential to reduce nasopharyngeal colonization (a major prerequisite for pneumococcal pathogenesis) as a component of a common pneumococcal protein vaccine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community acquired pneumonia; however, only a small proportion of cases can be detected by conventional methods. The ability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test performed on whole blood samples to identify patients with pneumococcal pneumonia was investigated. METHODS One hundred and fourteen consecutive adult patients with community acquired pneumonia were evaluated by a wide battery of diagnostic tests in order to determine the aetiology. Blood samples from these patients and 50 controls were also tested by the nested PCR test to detect selected pneumolysin gene fragments of S pneumoniae. RESULTS The patients were divided into four groups: (1) 40 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia in 22 of whom (55{\%}) the PCR was positive (eight of 11 with bacteraemia and 14 of 29 without); (2) 30 with pneumonia due to other pathogens in all of whom the PCR was negative; (3) 44 with pneumonia of unknown aetiology in 14 of whom (32{\%}) PCR was positive, and (4) 50 controls in whom the PCR test was positive in two (4{\%}). Thus, the sensitivity of the test was 55{\%} and the specificity 100{\%} (81{\%} if positive PCR tests among undiagnosed patients are considered as false positive results). CONCLUSION PCR applied to whole blood samples appears to be a sensitive and very specific diagnostic test for identifying patients with pneumococcal pneumonia with a potential application in clinical practice.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: With routine childhood vaccination using heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, one concern has been the potential for emergence and expansion of replacement disease caused by serotypes not contained in the heptavalent conjugate vaccine. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether replacement disease is associated with the overall decline in invasive pneumococcal disease among Alaska Native children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Alaska statewide longitudinal population-based laboratory surveillance of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and types of pneumococcal disease in children younger than 2 years. RESULTS: In the first 3 years after introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, overall invasive pneumococcal disease decreased 67{\%} in Alaska Native children younger than 2 years (from 403.2 per 100,000 in 1995-2000 to 134.3 per 100,000 per year in 2001-2003, P{\textless}.001). However, between 2001-2003 and 2004-2006, there was an 82{\%} increase in invasive disease in Alaska Native children younger than 2 years to 244.6/100,000 (P = .02). Since 2004, the invasive pneumococcal disease rate caused by nonvaccine serotypes has increased 140{\%} compared with the prevaccine period (from 95.1 per 100,000 in 1995-2000 to 228.6 in 2004-2006, P = .001). During the same period, there was a 96{\%} decrease in heptavalent vaccine serotype disease. Serotype 19A accounted for 28.3{\%} of invasive pneumococcal disease among Alaska children younger than 2 years during 2004-2006. There was no significant increase in nonvaccine disease in non-Native Alaska children younger than 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Alaska Native children are experiencing replacement invasive pneumococcal disease with serotypes not covered by heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The demonstration of replacement invasive pneumococcal disease emphasizes the importance of ongoing surveillance and development of expanded valency vaccines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND To describe the utilisation of antibiotics in children and adolescents across 5 European countries based on the same drug utilisation measures and age groups. Special attention was given to age-group-specific distributions of antibiotic subgroups, since comparison in this regard between countries is lacking so far. METHODS Outpatient paediatric prescriptions of systemic antibiotics during the years 2005-2008 were analysed using health care databases from the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy and Germany. Annual antibiotic prescription rates per 1,000 person years were estimated for each database and stratified by age (≤4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-18 years). Age-group-specific distributions of antibiotic subgroups were calculated for 2008. RESULTS With 957 prescriptions per 1000 person years, the highest annual prescription rate in the year 2008 was found in the Italian region Emilia Romagna followed by Germany (561), the UK (555), Denmark (481) and the Netherlands (294). Seasonal peaks during winter months were most pronounced in countries with high utilisation. Age-group-specific use varied substantially between countries with regard to total prescribing and distributions of antibiotic subgroups. However, prescription rates were highest among children in the age group ≤4 years in all countries, predominantly due to high use of broad spectrum penicillins. CONCLUSIONS Strong increases of antibiotic prescriptions in winter months in high utilising countries most likely result from frequent antibiotic treatment of mostly viral infections. This and strong variations of overall and age-group-specific distributions of antibiotic subgroups across countries, suggests that antibiotics are inappropriately used to a large extent.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite widespread immunization programs, a clear increase in pertussis incidence is apparent in many developed countries during the last decades. Consequently, additional immunization strategies are considered to reduce the burden of disease. The aim of this study is to design an individual-based stochastic dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population in order to predict the epidemiologic and economic consequences of the implementation of universal booster vaccination programs. Using this framework, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal adolescent pertussis booster vaccination at the age of 12 years in the Netherlands.

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We designed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to predict the epidemiological and economic consequences of implementing universal adolescent booster vaccination. We used national age-specific notification data over the period 1996-2000--corrected for underreporting--to calibrate the model assuming a steady state situation. Subsequently, booster vaccination was introduced. Input parameters of the model were derived from literature, national data sources (e.g. costing data, incidence and hospitalization data) and expert opinions. As there is no consensus on the duration of immunity acquired by natural infection, we considered two scenarios for this duration of protection (i.e. 8 and 15 years). In both scenarios, total pertussis incidence decreased as a result of adolescent vaccination. From a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness was estimated at €4418/QALY (range: 3205-6364 € per QALY) and €6371/QALY (range: 4139-9549 € per QALY) for the 8- and 15-year protection scenarios, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the outcomes are most sensitive to the quality of life weights used for pertussis disease.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge we designed the first individual-based dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population. This study indicates that adolescent pertussis vaccination is likely to be a cost-effective intervention for The Netherlands. The model is suited to investigate further pertussis booster vaccination strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We have previously shown that the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PncCRM) given in infancy is effective in reducing tympanostomy tube placements up to 4 to 5 years of age. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines PncCRM and PncOMPC from 2 up to 13 years of age. METHODS Altogether 2497 children participated in the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine trial conducted in 1995 to 1999 and were vaccinated at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age with PncCRM or PncOMPC or hepatitis B vaccine as controls. The data for tympanostomy tube placements were collected from health registers including hospital and private office operations. Vaccine efficacy was estimated by comparing incidences of tympanostomies from 2 to 12-13 years of age in each of the pneumococcal vaccine groups with the control group. RESULTS Register data were searched for 2474 subjects. A total of 535 tympanostomy tube placements were identified in the health registers from 1998 through 2008 with a cumulative incidence of 14.6{\%} from 2 to 13 years of age in the control group. The vaccine impact was age-dependent: from 2 through 5 years of age the vaccine effectiveness was 34{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 1{\%} to 52{\%}) for PncCRM and 6{\%} (-28 to 31) for the PncOMPC vaccine. For the age group of 6 to 12-13 years the vaccine effectiveness estimates for the PncCRM and PncOMPC groups were -13{\%} (-137 to 46) and -2{\%} (-123 to 54), respectively. CONCLUSIONS PncCRM vaccine reduced the tympanostomy tube placements up to 5 years of age. No impact on new surgical procedures could be demonstrated after that but the benefit achieved was sustained.},

abstract = {Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the leading infectious causes of childhood morbidity and mortality. We comprehensively reviewed the epidemiology of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia in 2010-11 to inform the planning of integrated control programmes for both illnesses. We estimated that, in 2010, there were 1???731 billion episodes of diarrhoea (36 million of which progressed to severe episodes) and 120 million episodes of pneumonia (14 million of which progressed to severe episodes) in children younger than 5 years. We estimated that, in 2011, 700 000 episodes of diarrhoea and 1???3 million of pneumonia led to death. A high proportion of deaths occurs in the fi rst 2 years of life in both diseases-72{\%} for diarrhoea and 81{\%} for pneumonia. The epidemiology of childhood diarrhoea and that of pneumonia overlap, which might be partly because of shared risk factors, such as undernutrition, suboptimum breastfeeding, and zinc defi ciency. Rotavirus is the most common cause of vaccine-preventable severe diarrhoea (associated with 28{\%} of cases), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (18???3{\%}) of vaccine-preventable severe pneumonia. Morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea are falling, but action is needed globally and at country level to accelerate the reduction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the current indications for myringotomy with tube placement. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2004, revised clinical practice guidelines for otitis media with effusion (OME) and acute otitis media (AOM) were published. Because of the rate of spontaneous resolution of otitis in children, these guidelines suggest more 'watchful waiting' in both disease processes. Recent literature has recommended an even longer observation period in children with OME of up to 9-18 months. In adults, indications for myringotomy with tube placement have remained unchanged. We will discuss the changes in indications for myringotomy with tube placement and review the recent literature and trends in this area. SUMMARY: In children, indicator guideline changes have been shown to not affect speech, language, and cognitive development, but further study is needed to find the right balance of observation, antibiotics, and myringotomy with tube placement for otitis media. Future vaccines may further decrease the number of children requiring myringotomy with tube placement for otitis media.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The degree and time frame of indirect effects of vaccination (serotype replacement and herd immunity) are key determinants in assessing the net effectiveness of vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in control of pneumococcal disease. Using modelling, we aimed to quantify these effects and their dependence on coverage of vaccination and the vaccine's efficacy against susceptibility to pneumococcal carriage.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed an individual-based simulation model that explores the effects of large-scale PCV programmes and applied it in a developed country setting (Finland). A population structure with transmission of carriage taking place within relevant mixing groups (families, day care groups, schools and neighbourhoods) was considered in order to properly assess the dependency of herd immunity on coverage of vaccination and vaccine efficacy against carriage. Issues regarding potential serotype replacement were addressed by employing a novel competition structure between multiple pneumococcal serotypes. Model parameters were calibrated from pre-vaccination data about the age-specific carriage prevalence and serotype distribution. The model predicts that elimination of vaccine-type carriage and disease among those vaccinated and, due to a substantial herd effect, also among the general population takes place within 5-10 years since the onset of a PCV programme with high (90{\%}) coverage of vaccination and moderate (50{\%}) vaccine efficacy against acquisition of carriage. A near-complete replacement of vaccine-type carriage by non-vaccine-type carriage occurs within the same time frame.

CONCLUSIONS: The changed patterns in pneumococcal carriage after PCV vaccination predicted by the model are unequivocal. The overall effect on disease incidence depends crucially on the magnitude of age- and serotype-specific case-to-carrier ratios of the remaining serotypes relative to those of the vaccine types. Thus the availability of reliable data on the incidence of both pneumococcal carriage and disease is essential in assessing the net effectiveness of PCV vaccination in a given epidemiological setting.},

abstract = {Background: In 2000, seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the USA and resulted in dramatic reductions in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and moderate increases in non-PCV7 type IPD. In 2010, PCV13 replaced PCV7 in the US immunisation schedule. We aimed to assess the effect of use of PCV13 in children on IPD in children and adults in the USA. Methods: We used laboratory-based and population-based data on incidence of IPD from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program) in a time-series model to compare rates of IPD before and after the introduction of PCV13. Cases of IPD between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2013, were classified as being caused by the PCV13 serotypes against which PCV7 has no effect (PCV13 minus PCV7). In a time-series model, we used an expected outcomes approach to compare the reported incidence of IPD to that which would have been expected if PCV13 had not replaced PCV7. Findings: Compared with incidence expected among children younger than 5 years if PCV7 alone had been continued, incidence of IPD overall declined by 64{\%} (95{\%} interval estimate [95{\%} IE] 59-68) and IPD caused by PCV13 minus PCV7 serotypes declined by 93{\%} (91-94), by July, 2012, to June, 2013. Among adults, incidence of IPD overall also declined by 12-32{\%} and IPD caused by PCV13 minus PCV7 type IPD declined by 58-72{\%}, depending on age. We estimated that over 30 000 cases of IPD and 3000 deaths were averted in the first 3 years after the introduction of PCV13. Interpretation: PCV13 reduced IPD across all age groups when used routinely in children in the USA. These findings provide reassurance that, similar to PCV7, PCVs with additional serotypes can also prevent transmission to unvaccinated populations.

abstract = {Background: This nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage surveillance study was requested by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products as a post-licensing commitment to determine whether the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) including 7 then 13 valents (introduced in 2001 and 2010, respectively) caused a shift in the distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in children with acute otitis media and modified the resistance of this bacterial species to antibiotics. Methods: Between 2001 and 2014, 121 pediatricians obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from children with acute otitis media aged 6-24 months. The swabs were analyzed by the French National Reference Centre for Pneumococci. Demographics, medical history and physical examination findings were recorded. Results: Over the 13 years, among the 7991 enrolled patients, the proportion of PCV-vaccinated children (???1 dose) increased (54.3-99.7{\%}, p{\textless}. 0.001). Overall, pneumococcal carriage was reduced from 71.2{\%} to 56.2{\%} from 2001 to 2014 (p{\textless}. 0.001) and carriage of PCV7 serotypes (STs) from 44.5{\%} to 1.2{\%} (p{\textless}. 0.001). The carriage of 6 additional STs plus 6C increased from 17.2{\%} to 24.3{\%} from 2001 to 2010 (p{\textless}. 0.001) and decreased after PCV13 implementation (21.4-3.5{\%}, p{\textless}. 0.001). The proportion of ST 19A carriage increased from 8.6{\%} to 15.8{\%} from 2001 to 2010 (p{\textless}. 0.001) and decreased to 1.2{\%} in 2014. After PCV13 implementation, the most frequently carried non-PCV13 STs were ST 15B/C, 11A, 15A, and 35B. Penicillin non-susceptible pneumococcal strains decreased from 67.1{\%} in 2001 to 33.1{\%} in 2014 (p{\textless}. 0.001). Conclusions: By the number of patients enrolled and the duration, this study is the largest performed to date. It allows to demonstrate a strong impact of PCVs and to describe the complex dynamics of pneumococcal carriage during AOM. As pneumococcal carriage decreased during AOM, a reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal AOM could be expected.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute suppurative otitis media is one of the most common infectious diseases in childhood. Recurrent acute otitis media is defined for the purposes of this review as either three or more acute infections of the middle ear cleft in a six-month period, or at least four episodes in a year. Strategies for managing the condition include the assessment and modification of risk factors where possible, repeated courses of antibiotics for each new infection, antibiotic prophylaxis and the insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets). OBJECTIVES To establish whether ventilation tube insertion reduces the frequency of episodes of recurrent acute otitis media and the proportion of children with symptoms of ear disease. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), CINAHL, mRCT (the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for ongoing/unpublished trials), NRR (National Research Register), LILACs, KoreaMed, IndMed, PakMediNet, Zetoc, ISI Proceedings and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. Reference lists of articles retrieved from the electronic searches were scanned for further trials. Systematic reviews and other meta-analyses were also searched for and their reference lists scanned. Contact was sought with authors of published trials and other experts in the field. The date of the last search was March 2008. SELECTION CRITERIA No trials that included a treatment and a control group that met the inclusion criteria were excluded. Abstracts were screened and full text articles of studies that met our inclusion criteria obtained. Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria. Studies included in the review underwent quality assessment performed independently by all authors adapting the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted independently by the authors and synthesised descriptively. Five randomised controlled trials were identified, of which two fulfilled the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS Two studies involving 148 children were included in the review. One of these studies, involving 95 children, showed that ventilation tube insertion leads to a mean reduction of 1.5 episodes of acute otitis media in the first six months after treatment. This study also showed a significant increase in the proportion of children with no episodes of AOM (p {\textless} 0.001) in the ventilation tube group. The other included study also found a higher proportion of patients in the ventilation tube group had no episodes of AOM in the six months after intervention, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.16). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Ventilation tubes have a significant role in maintaining a 'disease-free' state in the first six months after insertion. Further research is required to investigate the effect beyond six months. Clinicians should consider the possible adverse effects of grommet insertion before surgery is undertaken.},

abstract = {An important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time. This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including local trends, seasonality and the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on simulated data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by estimating the causal effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of state-space models in enabling causal attribution in those settings where a randomised experiment is unavailable. The CausalImpact R package provides an implementation of our approach.},

abstract = {Relatedness between isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae can be determined from sequences of multiple genes belonging to the core genome (multilocus sequence typing [MLST]), but these do not provide information on gene content that may affect the potential of isolates to cause invasive pneumococcal disease. Gene content data, obtained using microarrays, were gathered for 40 clinical isolates of 12 serotypes belonging to 30 multilocus sequence types. We found that sequence variations in housekeeping genes assessed by MLST correlated well with whole-genome microarray analyses identifying the presence/absence of accessory genes/regions. However, isolates belonging to the same clonal complex, as determined by MLST, may not have identical gene contents, potentially affecting virulence. We found fewer intraclonal (same MLST sequence type) differences associated with pneumococcal serotypes of high invasive disease potential, i.e., serotypes rarely found among carriers compared to serotypes frequently found in carriage. Molecular typing of pneumococci based on the presence/absence of 25 genes localized to accessory regions shows the same relatedness among pneumococcal strains as MLST does. We conclude that molecular typing of pneumococci based on variation in the nucleotide sequences of parts of housekeeping genes (MLST) correlates with the presence/absence of genes in the accessory part of the genome. This covariation is likely due to the fact that both sequence variations and gene content variations are created primarily by recombination events in pneumococci.},

abstract = {Aim: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease, which often becomes recurrent (rAOM). A small reduction in AOM episodes has been noted in unselected child cohorts after vaccination with heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). The purpose of this study was to investigate how vaccination affects young children at risk of developing rAOM. Methods: Ninety-six children with an AOM onset before 6 months of age, implying a high risk for rAOM, were closely monitored until the age of 2 years. Forty-six were vaccinated with PCV7 and 50 were not. All episodes of AOM, emergency visits and ventilation tube insertions were registered. Results: A total of 363 AOM episodes were diagnosed. The incidence was reduced by 26{\%} (p = 0.03), the number of emergency visits because of suspected AOM by 36{\%} (p = 0.01) and the proportion of children who received ventilation tubes was halved in the vaccine group (p = 0.02). Conclusions: During the first 2 years of life, PCV7 significantly reduced AOM episodes, emergency visits and ventilation tube insertions in children with rAOM. Pneumococcal vaccine may be a future route to reduce antibiotic use and health care consumption in otitis-prone children. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The observation option was considered reasonable by 83.3{\%}, compared with 88.0{\%} in 2004, and was used in a median of 15{\%} of acute otitis media cases over the previous 3 months. The most common physician-identified barriers to the use of the observation option were parental reluctance (83.5{\%}) and the cost and difficulty of follow-up of children who do not improve (30.9{\%}). In terms of antibiotic choices for acute otitis media, agreement with the guideline's antibiotic recommendation for 4 common clinical scenarios was as follows: high-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media with nonsevere symptoms (57.2{\%}), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media with severe symptoms (12.7{\%}), high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for cases that failed to respond to amoxicillin (42.8{\%}), and intramuscular ceftriaxone for cases that failed to respond to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate (16.7{\%}). Each of these proportions declined from 2004. CONCLUSIONS Most primary care physicians accept the concept of an observation option for acute otitis media but use it only occasionally. Antibiotics prescribed for acute otitis media differ markedly from the guideline's recommendations, and the difference has increased since 2004.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the immunisation schedule in England and Wales, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) was replaced by the 13-valent vaccine (PCV-13) in April 2010 after having been used since September 2006. The introduction of PCV-7 was informed by a cost effectiveness analysis using an infectious disease model which projected herd immunity and serotype replacement effects based on the post-vaccine experience in the United States at that time.

AIM: To investigate the cost effectiveness of the introduction of PCV-13.

METHOD: Invasive disease incidence following vaccination was projected from a dynamic infectious disease model, and combined with serotype specific disease outcomes obtained from a large hospital dataset linked to laboratory confirmation of invasive pneumococcal disease. The economic impact of replacing PCV-7 with PCV-13 was compared to stopping the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination altogether.

RESULTS: Discontinuing PCV-7 would lead to a projected increase in invasive pneumococcal disease, costs and loss of quality of life compared to the introduction of PCV-13. However under base case assumptions (assuming no impact on non-invasive disease, maximal competition between vaccine and non-vaccine types, time horizon of 30 years, vaccine price of {\pounds}49.60 a dose+{\pounds}7.50 administration costs and discounting of costs and benefits at 3.5{\%}) the introduction of PCV-13 is only borderline cost effective compared to a scenario of discontinuing of PCV-7. The intervention becomes more cost-effective when projected impact of non-invasive disease is included or the discount factor for benefits is reduced to 1.5{\%}.

CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first evaluation of a transition from PCV-7 to PCV-13 based on a dynamic model. The cost-effectiveness of such a policy change depends on a number of crucial assumptions for which evidence is limited, particularly the impact of PCV-13 on non-invasive disease.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen of pediatric head and neck infections (HNIs), e.g. acute otitis media (AOM), acute mastoiditis (AM), acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) and meningitis. The aim of the study was to characterize the epidemiolo gy of pneumococcal HNIs (pHNIs) before, during, and after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). METHODS Children 0-16 years who were hospitalized with HNIs in the Pediatrics Department in a general hospital between 1/1/2007-12/31/2014 were retrospectively identified. Study years were categorized according to the PCV introduction timeline: 2007-2008, 'pre-PCV years', 2009-2011, 'transition years', and 2012-2014, 'post-PCV years'. pHNIs episodes were defined if pneumococcal culture or urine antigen was positive. Children who received ≥2 doses of PCV7/PCV13 were considered as immunized. All other children were considered as unimmunized. RESULTS HNIs accounted for 2.5-4.7{\%} of the total admissions; 3-17{\%} of them were pHNIs. 87 pHNI episodes were identified: AOM (n=42), AM (n=28) and meningitis (n=17). There was a downward trend in the overall incidence of HNIs, and particularly of pHNIs, in the post-PCV years. The average age and hospitalization duration of children with HNIs/pHNIs remained stable during the study years. In 2009-2010, pHNIs incidence sharply decreased, from 7 to 1.74/1,000 hospitalized children/year, due to {\~{}}55{\%} reduction of pneumococcal AOM episodes. An additional decrease was observed in the post-PCV years (1.62/1,000 hospitalized children/year). Immunized children were less likely to present with pHNIs (p=0.001), but were more likely to undergo surgery (p=0.042). CONCLUSION We observed a reduction in pHNIs incidence after PCV program implementation.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: Day care attendance and antibiotic consumption are major risk factors for carriage of antibiotic-susceptible and non-susceptible pneumococci. We describe the nasopharyngeal carriage of antibiotic-susceptible and non-susceptible pneumococci among children at day care centres (DCCs), analyse the association of potential risk factors with carriage, and examine the effects of a hygiene intervention on carriage. Methods: Thirty DCCs in 2 communities were included in a cohort intervention trial. Nasopharyngeal cultures and information on the children were obtained every 6 months. The study lasted 2.5 y and the hygiene intervention was introduced at half of the DCCs during the last 1.5 y of the study. The results were analysed using a mixed effects logistic regression model. Results: A total of 5663 cultures were obtained from 2399 children, of which 55.6{\%} grew pneumococci. Of the pneumococci, 27.9{\%} were penicillin-non-susceptible (PNSP). The hygiene intervention was associated with a decreased risk of pneumococcal carriage, but this did not reach statistical significance for PNSP carriage. Pneumococcal and PNSP carriage was negatively associated with age, varied significantly between DCCs, and was positively associated with the number of preceding colds. Individual antibiotic use (mainly penicillin/amoxicillin) at the time of sampling and/or during the preceding month was associated with a decreased risk of pneumococcal and PNSP carriage. Individual use of cephalosporins was associated with an increased risk of carriage of penicillin and TMP-SMX-non-susceptible pneumococci. Conclusion: The hygiene intervention at the DCCs reduced the risk of pneumococcal carriage and the individual use of antibiotics was found to affect carriage in a complex manner.},

In this study we followed nasopharyngeal carriage in Bangladeshi infants (n=99) from birth, with 2-week sampling intervals until age 4 months, and monthly thereafter until age 1 year, and also their family members at the same intervals. We assessed the dependence of pneumococcal acquisition rates on age, serotype, serotype-specific exposure (i.e. transmission) and current state of carriage (yes/no). A statistical model of pneumococcal transmission, taking into account incompletely observed data, was applied to estimate rates of acquisition and clearance for a large number of serotypes at the same time. Serotypes that were common in the study population were more often acquired from the community than rarer serotypes. However, when conditioning on serotype-specific exposure within the family, transmission rates were similar between different serotypes. Exposure within families signified more than tenfold increase in the rate of acquisition.},

abstract = {Several lines of epidemiological and microbiological studies point to the multiple and critical roles of the nasopharynx of children-particularly those of pre-school age and attending day-care centres (DCCs)-in the emergence and spread of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRP). A systematic yearly surveillance of the nasopharyngeal flora of children attending DCCs has been carried out in Lisbon since 1996. Molecular typing of several hundred DRP isolates showed that the great majority of DRP were represented by a relatively few clonal types that were frequently carried by many children in geographically distant DCCs and over several years of surveillance. The same epidemic DRP clones were also frequent among pneumococci causing both paediatric and adult disease worldwide. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci carry sequences of heterologous origin in their pbp genes and also in the recently identified murM: a gene essential for expression of penicillin resistance and for the unique cell wall structure of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Virtually all DRP express only a limited number (five or six) of the very large genetic repertoire (up to 90) of serotypes available for this bacterial species and the serotypes of drug-resistant strains happens to be the same as the serotypes of drug-susceptible pneumococci that most frequently colonize pre-school age children. These observations strongly suggest that the nasopharynx of children is an important global ecological reservoir of DRP and may also play a critical role as the favoured anatomical site for the evolution of DRP.},

Specific aim is to review presenting symptoms, risk factors, tympanostomy tube outcomes and complications, and need for further procedures. Methods: A web-based customized database was constructed to universally enroll all patients seen in consultation with a diagnosis of OM. Unique database fields include demographics, physical exam findings, risk factors, intervention, and long-term outcomes. Major surgical complications measured include: tympanic membrane perforation, retained tubes, chronic otorrhea, and cholesteatoma formation. Results: Six hundred and thirty four unique patients have been prospectively enrolled. Five hundred and forty four tubes have been followed to extrusion. Outcomes demonstrate high prevalence of OM risk factors associated with surgical patients including: 63{\%} in day care and 26{\%} with a sibling requiring tympanostomy tubes. Complication rates; 1{\%} developed perforations requiring surgical intervention, 2.6{\%} required removal of retained tubes, 1{\%} extruded early ({\textless}60 days), and 0.7{\%} were surgically removed for other complications. Cholesteatoma was identified in 0.56{\%}, all had ongoing chronic ear disease. Conclusions: Long-term, outcome driven investigations assessing the surgical management of OM are needed given the prevalence of this disease and the frequency of surgical intervention required. The current database represents the largest prospective cohort of patients enrolled and followed in this fashion and has generated data demonstrating a procedure associated with significant improvement in patient quality of life in the short-term with low complication rates in the long-term.

Data Sources. Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched for randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials and cohort studies in English, Scandinavian, German, and French languages between 1966 and April 2007.

A total of 493 abstracts were evaluated independently by 2 members of the project group, 247 full-text versions were assessed for inclusion criteria and quality using structured evaluation forms, and 63 articles were included in the review. Results and Conclusions. This review shows that there is strong scientific evidence (grade 1) that VT treatment of SOM improves hearing for at least 9 months and that QoL is improved for up to 9 months (grade 2 scientific evidence). There was insufficient evidence to support an effect of VT treatment for rAOM. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether the design or material of the VT or the procedure used for insertion had any influence on the effect; however, there was some evidence (grade 3) that aspiration of secretion at insertion does not prolong VT treatment. Further research is needed to address these issues. (copyright) American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In 2009, the European Medicines Agency granted approval for two higher-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal infant ({\textless}2 years old) vaccination with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in comparison with a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in Germany. METHODS A population-based Markov model was developed to estimate the impact of PCV13 and PCV10 on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), non-invasive pneumonia (PNE), and acute otitis media (AOM) over a time horizon of 50 years. The model included the effects of the historical vaccination scheme in infants as well as indirect herd effects and replacement disease. We used German epidemiological data to calculate episodes of IPD, PNE, and AOM, as well as direct and indirect effects of the vaccination. Parameter uncertainty was tested in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS In the base-case analysis, the ICER of PCV13 versus PCV10 infant vaccination was EUR 9826 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or EUR 5490 per life-year (LY) gained from the societal perspective and EUR 3368 per QALY gained or EUR 1882 per LY gained from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. The results were particularly sensitive to the magnitude of indirect effects of both vaccines. CONCLUSIONS Universal infant vaccination with PCV13 is likely to be a cost-effective intervention compared with PCV10 within the German health care system, if additional net indirect effects of PCV13 vaccination are significant.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal diseases remain a leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children {\textless}5 years of age. The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was approved in 2001 in Europe and was introduced into the national immunization programmes of many European countries from 2006-2008. In 2009, higher-valent PCVs (PCV10 and PCV13) became available, replacing PCV7 from 2009-2011. This article describes the evolution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) following the introduction of PCVs in Western Europe, based on data from publicly-available medical publications and national surveillance systems from January 2010 to May 2015.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: In countries with high vaccine uptake, 5-7 years after PCV7 introduction IPD caused by vaccine serotypes has almost disappeared in children. Non-PCV7 serotypes have emerged, particularly serotypes 19A, 7 F, 3 and 1. A rapid and significant reduction of the additional serotypes included in higher-valent vaccines has been observed consistently following the introduction of these vaccines. A significant and rapid decline of serotypes 19A, 7 F, 1 and 6A in both vaccine-eligible and older age groups has been observed in countries using PCV13 while serotype 19A and 3 has increased in countries using PCV10. Serotype 3 has become one of the most prevalent serotypes in adults, with some reduction only in the UK and France. Serotype diversity increased and varied by age group, the type of vaccine in use, and the time since the introduction of higher-valent PCVs. Serotypes that are currently more frequent include 24 F, 22 F, 8 and 15A in countries that use PCV13, and serotypes 19A and 3 in countries that use PCV10. Compared with the time before the introduction of higher valent PCVs, to date, there is no single '19A-like' serotype emerging across countries and most of the newly emerging non-PCV13 vaccine types are less invasive with a low case-carrier ratio.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: It is important to closely monitor not only evolving serotypes but also the magnitude of the effect in order to evaluate the overall impact of pneumococcal vaccination programmes and to initiate the appropriate vaccination strategy. Emerging serotypes may also need to be considered for the future development of new vaccines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobials are frequently prescribed for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), although many are viral. We aimed to determine bacterial prevalence rates for 5 common childhood ARTI - acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis- and to compare these rates to nationally representative antimicrobial prescription rates for these ARTI. METHODS: We performed (1) a meta-analysis of English language pediatric studies published between 2000 and 2011 in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library to determine ARTI bacterial prevalence rates; and (2) a retrospective cohort analysis of children age {\textless}18 years evaluated in ambulatory clinics sampled by the 2000-2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) to determine estimated US ARTI antimicrobial prescribing rates. RESULTS: From the meta-analysis, the AOM bacterial prevalence was 64.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 50.5{\%}-77.7{\%}); Streptococcus pyogenes prevalence during pharyngitis was 20.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 15.9{\%}-25.2{\%}). No URI or bronchitis studies met inclusion criteria, and 1 sinusitis study met inclusion criteria, identifying bacteria in 78{\%} of subjects. Based on these condition-specific bacterial prevalence rates, the expected antimicrobial rescribing rate for ARTI overall was 27.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 26.5{\%}-28.3{\%}). However, antimicrobial agents were prescribed in NAMCS during 56.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 50.8{\%}-63.1{\%}) of ARTI encounters, representing an estimated 11.4 million potentially preventable antimicrobial prescriptions annually. CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 27.4{\%} of US children who have ARTI have bacterial illness in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era. Antimicrobials are prescribed almost twice as often as expected during outpatient ARTI visits, representing an important target for ongoing antimicrobial stewardship interventions.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Determine the incremental health care costs associated with the diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) in children. Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of a national health-care cost database. Methods: Pediatric patients (age {\textless} 18 years) were examined from the 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. From the linked medical conditions file, cases with a diagnosis of AOM were extracted, along with comorbid conditions. Ambulatory visit rates, prescription refills, and ambulatory health care costs were then compared between children with and without a di-agnosis of AOM, adjusting for age, sex, region, race, ethnicity, insurance coverage, and Charlson comorbidity Index. Results: A total of 8.7 6 0.4 million children were diagnosed with AOM (10.7 6 0.4{\%} annually, mean age 5.3 years, 51.3{\%} male) among 81.5 6 2.3 million children sampled (mean age 8.9 years, 51.3{\%} male). Children with AOM manifested an additional 12.0 office visits, 10.2 emergency department visits, and 11.6 prescription fills (all P {\textless}0.001) per year versus those without AOM, adjusting for demographics and medical comorbidities. Similarly, AOM was associated with an incremen-tal increase in outpatient health care costs of {\$}314 per child annually (P {\textless}0.001) and an increase of {\$}17 in patient medica-tion costs (P {\textless}0.001), but was not associated with an increase in total prescription expenses ({\$}13, P 5 0.766). Conclusions: The diagnosis of AOM confers a significant incremental health-care utilization burden on both patients and the health care system. With its high prevalence across the United States, pediatric AOM accounts for approximately {\$}2.88 bil-lion in added health care expense annually and is a significant health-care utilization concern.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In April 2010, a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 for use in the United States. We evaluated rates of pneumococcal colonization, by serotype and antibiotic resistance, in Massachusetts communities where serial cross-sectional surveillance has been conducted for the past decade. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from children 0 to {\textless}7 years of age and seen by primary care providers for well child or acute illness visits in 2001, 2004, 2007, 2009, and 2011. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped by Quellung reaction and classified as PCV7 serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F), additional PCV13 serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A), or non-PCV13 serotypes. Changes in colonization and impact of PCV13 were assessed using generalized linear mixed models, adjusting for known risk factors and accounting for clustering by community. RESULTS: Introduction of PCV13 did not affect the rate of overall pneumococcal colonization (31{\%} in 2011). Colonization with non-PCV13 serotypes increased between 2001 and 2011 for all children (odds ratio [OR] per year, 1.12; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.10, 1.15; P {\textless} .0001). 19A remained the second most common serotype in 2011, although a decline from 2009 was observed. Penicillin (7{\%}), erythromycin (28{\%}), ceftriaxone (10{\%}), and clindamycin (10{\%}) nonsusceptibility were commonly identified, concentrated among a small number of serotypes (including 19A, 35B, 15B/C, and 15A). Among healthy children 6-23 months old, colonization with PCV13 serotypes was lower among recipients of PCV13 vaccine (adjusted OR, 0.30; 95{\%} CI, 0.11, 0.78). This effect was not observed in 6- to 23-month-old children with a concomitant respiratory tract infection (adjusted OR 1.36; 95{\%} CI, 0.66, 2.77) or children 2 to {\textless}7 years old (adjusted OR, 1.17; 95{\%} CI, 0.58, 2.34). CONCLUSIONS: 13-Valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reduced the prevalence of colonization with PCV13 serotypes among children 6-23 months old, but its efficacy was not shown among older children.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate parental recall of surgical risks and benefits in pediatric otolaryngology and to assess for factors that may influence recall. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Academic pediatric otolaryngology clinic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Eighty-four parents of children {\textless}6 years of age who underwent consultation for adeno/tonsillectomy and/or tympanostomy tube insertion were prospectively enrolled. Consultation visits were video recorded and the benefits and risks of surgery documented. Two weeks following the consultation, parents were contacted for assessment of recall of information discussed during the consultation. RESULTS Overall, parents recalled only one-third of the risks of surgery mentioned by the surgeons. Parents were significantly more likely to recall the benefits of surgery as opposed to the risks (P {\textless} .001). Nine parents (10.7{\%}) reported that no benefits were discussed during the consultation, and 10 (11.9{\%}) reported no mention of any risks. Inconsistencies were present in which risks and benefits were mentioned by the providers. Parents who decided to proceed with surgery (58.3{\%}) were significantly less likely to recall the surgical risks than those who did not (P {\textless} .001). The specific surgeon involved, the number of caregivers present, parental education level, and prior surgical history did not influence recall. CONCLUSION Parental recall of benefits and risks associated with common pediatric otolaryngology procedures was poor. This information is important because a low rate of recall may influence parents' perspectives of the procedure and could alter their decision-making processes or expectations. Methods to improve parental recall should be further studied.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe a cost-effectiveness analysis of 10- or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10 or 13) introduction in Paraguay compared to no vaccination. Methods: The integrated TRIVAC vaccine cost-effectiveness model (version 2.0) jointly developed by the Pan American Health Organization's ProVac Initiative and the London School of Hygiene {\&} Tropical Medicine was applied from the government and societal perspectives to estimate the cost-effectiveness (CE) of PCV introduction during 2010 and 2011. The cost-effectiveness ratios of PCV10 and PCV13 were separately compared to non-vaccination. The model calculated health and economic benefits of vaccination for 10 birth cohorts of children {\textless}5 years of age. A base case scenario with two primary doses at 2 and 4 months and a booster dose at 12 months (2. +. 1 schedule) and alternate scenarios with varying parameters were considered. Results: With PCV10 introduction, the incremental costs of the vaccination program would be approximately US{\$} 67 million to vaccinate all 10 cohorts of children; with PCV13, US{\$} 87 million. Health services costs avoided by the government with PCV10 would be US{\$} 19.5 million; with PCV 13, US{\$} 17.7 million. From the societal perspective, savings were much greater: with PCV10, US{\$} 43 million; with PCV13, US{\$} 35 million. For the higher priced PCV13, the average cost-effectiveness ratio was better than for PCV10 when compared to no vaccination, but regardless both were cost effective for government and society based on a threshold of 3?? GDP per capita in Paraguay (2009 US{\$} 2516). The number of averted meningitis and all-cause pneumonia cases and deaths was greater with PCV13 than with PCV10 when compared to no vaccination. Conclusion: The introduction of either PCV10 or PCV13 would be cost effective when compared to no vaccination, and in some scenarios, highly cost effective in Paraguay. The outcomes of these analyses demonstrate that a pneumococcal vaccine could substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in children {\textless}5 years in Paraguay.},

Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted according to World Health Organization guidelines with nontypeable isolates further analyzed by molecular serotyping.

abstract = {Blackwell Publishing is delighted to announce that this book has been Highly Commended in the 2004 BMA Medical Book Competition. Here is the judges summary of this book: This is a technical book on a technical subject but presented in a delightful way. There are many books on statistics for doctors but there are few that are excellent and this is certainly one of them. Statistics is not an easy subject to teach or write about. The authors have succeeded in producing a book that is as good as it can get. For the keen student who does not want a book for mathematicians, this is an excellent first book on medical statistics.Essential Medical Statistics is a classic amongst medical statisticians. An introductory textbook, it presents statistics with a clarity and logic that demystifies the subject, while providing a comprehensive coverage of advanced as well as basic methods. The second edition of Essential Medical Statistics has been comprehensively revised and updated to include modern statistical methods and modern approaches to statistical analysis, while retaining the approachable and non-mathematical style of the first edition. The book now includes full coverage of the most commonly used regression models, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression and Cox regression, as well as a chapter on general issues in regression modelling. In addition, new chapters introduce more advanced topics such as meta-analysis, likelihood, bootstrapping and robust standard errors, and analysis of clustered data.Aimed at students of medical statistics, medical researchers, public health practitioners and practising clinicians using statistics in their daily work, the book is designed as both a teaching and a reference text. The format of the book is clear with highlighted formulae and worked examples, so that all concepts are presented in a simple, practical and easy-to-understand way. The second edition enhances the emphasis on choice of appropriate methods with new chapters on strategies for analysis and measures of association and impact.Essential Medical Statistics is supported by a web site at This useful online resource provides statistical datasets to download, as well as sample chapters and future updates.},

abstract = {Temporal trends of serotypes from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Spain from 1979 to September 2007 under antibiotic and vaccine pressure were analyzed. A significant trend in pneumococcal conjugate 7-valent vaccine (PCV7) serotypes (except serotype 4) was found, whereby the prevalence increased from the early 1980s and decreased in the 2000s for all but serotype 23F, which began decreasing in the late 1980s. Among the major non-PCV7 serotypes, a significant decrease was observed for serotypes 1, 5, and 7F in the 1980s. From the late 1990s, serotypes 1, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A increased significantly, while serotypes 3 and 8 showed similar but nonsignificant trends over time. The incidence of IPD cases was 10.7/100,000 for the period 1996 to 2006, with reporting coverage ranging from 18{\%} to 43{\%}. A significant decrease in IPD incidence due to PCV7 serotypes was observed, while the incidence of non-PCV7 serotypes increased, with the consequence that there was no clear pattern in the overall incidence of IPD. Penicillin nonsusceptibility was correlated with the proportion of PCV7 serotypes. Erythromycin nonsusceptibility increased in association with long-half-life macrolide consumption and then decreased in 2004 to 2007. The increase in PCV7 serotypes and antibiotic nonsusceptibility related to antibiotic consumption in the 1980s and 1990s was reversed in the 2000s, probably as a result of PCV7 immunization. The decrease in IPD incidence due to PCV7 serotypes was mirrored by an increase in that of non-PCV7 serotypes. The impact of various preventive/therapeutic strategies on pneumococcal evolution is serotype dependent, and the dynamics remain unpredictable.},

By the late 1980s and 1990s, the emergence and rapid dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci was observed in southern and eastern Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia. Great geographical variability, both in serotype distribution and in the prevalence of resistant pneumococci, has been reported. However, the highest rates of resistance to penicillin and erythromycin worldwide were found in serotypes 6B, 6A, 9V, 14, 15A, 19F, 19A, and 23F. The introduction of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in the 2000s and a reduction in antimicrobial use were associated with a significant decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections and in rates of antibiotic resistance in the USA. However, an increase in the incidence of infections caused by non-PCV7 serotypes, especially multiresistant serotype 19A pneumococci, has been observed in many countries over the last 5 years. The dynamic character of serotypes and antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae should be controlled by a policy of prudent antibiotic use and by implementation of the new generation of conjugate vaccines},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Symptomatic relief is the primary goal of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in stable angina and is commonly observed clinically. However, there is no evidence from blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trials to show its efficacy. METHODS ORBITA is a blinded, multicentre randomised trial of PCI versus a placebo procedure for angina relief that was done at five study sites in the UK. We enrolled patients with severe (≥70{\%}) single-vessel stenoses. After enrolment, patients received 6 weeks of medication optimisation. Patients then had pre-randomisation assessments with cardiopulmonary exercise testing, symptom questionnaires, and dobutamine stress echocardiography. Patients were randomised 1:1 to undergo PCI or a placebo procedure by use of an automated online randomisation tool. After 6 weeks of follow-up, the assessments done before randomisation were repeated at the final assessment. The primary endpoint was difference in exercise time increment between groups. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle and the study population contained all participants who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02062593. FINDINGS ORBITA enrolled 230 patients with ischaemic symptoms. After the medication optimisation phase and between Jan 6, 2014, and Aug 11, 2017, 200 patients underwent randomisation, with 105 patients assigned PCI and 95 assigned the placebo procedure. Lesions had mean area stenosis of 84{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (SD 10{\textperiodcentered}2), fractional flow reserve of 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}16), and instantaneous wave-free ratio of 0{\textperiodcentered}76 (0{\textperiodcentered}22). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of exercise time increment between groups (PCI minus placebo 16{\textperiodcentered}6 s, 95{\%} CI -8{\textperiodcentered}9 to 42{\textperiodcentered}0, p=0{\textperiodcentered}200). There were no deaths. Serious adverse events included four pressure-wire related complications in the placebo group, which required PCI, and five major bleeding events, including two in the PCI group and three in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION In patients with medically treated angina and severe coronary stenosis, PCI did not increase exercise time by more than the effect of a placebo procedure. The efficacy of invasive procedures can be assessed with a placebo control, as is standard for pharmacotherapy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Countries generally present their overall use of antibiotics as an indicator of antibiotic prescribing quality. Additional insight is urgently needed for targeted improvement recommendations: first, data on specific clinical indications for which antibiotics are used, and second, on distinguishing whether changes in patient consultation or changes in physician prescribing drive changing antibiotic use for particular indications. The aim of this study was to describe the antibiotic management of infectious diseases in the clinical context, by analysing prescribing by physicians and patient consultation incidences per indication over time. METHODS: A database with all contact data for infectious diseases from 45 primary care practices in the Netherlands (2007-10) was used. Consultation incidences, prescribing rates and choice of antibiotic were analysed per International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) chapter and relevant ICPC codes. RESULTS: Antibiotics were prescribed in ∼25{\%} of infectious disease episodes, mainly respiratory infections, urinary infections and ear and skin infections. Overall, this resulted in 300 prescribed courses of antibiotics per 1000 patient-years. Given a stable prescription rate, a 19{\%} increase in the number of consultations explained the increased antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections. Given a stable consultation incidence, an 8{\%} reduction in prescribing rate explained the decreased antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections. Macrolides were predominantly prescribed for respiratory disease (∼66{\%}), amoxicillin/clavulanate for respiratory disease (∼42{\%}) and urinary illness (∼25{\%}), and fluoroquinolones for urinary and genital indications. CONCLUSIONS: Insight into the reasons for the decreased prescribing for respiratory tract infections and the increased prescribing for urinary tract infections was provided by a detailed analysis of incidences and prescribing rates. For respiratory disease, the second- and third-choice antibiotics were overused. Complete data on infectious disease management, with respect to patient and physician behaviour, are crucial for understanding changes in antibiotic use, and in defining strategies to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was earlier shown to reduce clinically suspected, non–laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in a cluster-randomized trial (the Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease trial). PCV10 was introduced into the Finnish national vaccination program in September 2010 using a 3-dose schedule. We evaluated the impact of PCV10 on clinically suspected IPD among vaccine-eligible children in a population-based nationwide study.METHODS: The target cohort eligible for vaccination program (children born June 2010–September 2013) was compared with 2 season- and age-matched (ages 3–42 months) reference cohorts before PCV10 introduction. The trial period (January 2009–August 2010) was excluded. Hospitals' inpatient and outpatient discharge notifications with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, diagnoses compatible with IPD (A40.3/B95.3/G00.1/M00.1) and unspecified sepsis (A40.9/A41.9/A49.9/G00/G00.9/I30.1/M00/M00.9/B95.5) were collected from the national Care Register. Laboratory-confirmed IPD cases were excluded. Rates of register-based non–laboratory-confirmed IPD (or unspecified sepsis) before and after PCV10 implementation were calculated.RESULTS: The rate of register-based non–laboratory-confirmed IPD episodes was 32 in 100 000 person-years in the vaccine-eligible target cohort and 94 in the combined reference cohorts. Relative rate reduction was 66{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 59–73) and absolute rate reduction 62 in 100 000 person-years. For the more sensitive case definition of register-based non–laboratory-confirmed IPD or unspecified sepsis, the relative rate reduction was 34{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 29–39), but the absolute reduction was as high as 122 in 100 000 person-years.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating nationwide PCV impact on clinically suspected IPD during routine vaccination program. The large absolute rate reductions observed have major implications for cost-effectiveness of PCVs.},

@article{DeWals2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) is available to immunize infants against pneumococcal disease. However, a recently developed vaccine, pneumococcal nontypable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV), has recently been licensed. PHiD-CV contains 3 additional Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes and may provide protection against nontypable H influenzae (NTHi) infection. New health economic models are required to model the impact of PHiD-CV and compare its effectiveness with PCV-7. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article was to design a model capable of projecting the pneumococcal and NTHi disease burden on the entire UK population under different schedules of PCV-7 and PHiD-CV. This model should also be capable of modeling the net indirect effect of vaccination (ie, the sum of serotype replacement and herd protection). METHODS: A static, deterministic, age-compartmental model was created based on published information and the input of a board of experts in pneumococcal disease. The model presents results from both a payer-based and societal perspective. A 1-way sensitivity analysis was used to demonstrate the robustness of the model. Key parameters included the case fatality ratio for bacteremia, the hospitalization rate for acute otitis media (AOM), and parameters surrounding the extent of the net indirect effect of vaccination. RESULTS: Excluding net indirect effect, 325 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 619 hospitalizations for pneumonia, and 9016 general practitioner visits for AOM would be prevented annually with the current PCV-7 2 + 1 program. These numbers would increase to 374, 755, and 30,920, respectively, using a PHiD-CV 2 + 1 regimen, or to 503, 994, and 47,180 using a PHiD-CV 3 + 1 regimen. When a net indirect effect of 38{\%} is considered, health benefits could be much larger; 2417, 2451, and 3045 IPD cases would be prevented in the 3 scenarios, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is predicted that any vaccination program in the United Kingdom would have a striking impact on the incidence of all outcomes analyzed. A PHiD-CV 3 + 1 schedule is predicted to have a greater effect than PCV-7 in all scenarios. While the primary purpose of vaccination would be to prevent IPD and pneumonia hospitalizations, an additional benefit would be a noticeable reduction in AOM incidence. While the predictions made by the model were based on informed reasoning, all of its projected estimations remain approximations that are dependent on the inputs used to configure it, a limitation that is common to all simulation models.},

abstract = {The application of economic evaluation in healthcare, including vaccination programs, has increased exponentially since the 1980s. There are a number of aspects of economic evaluation of vaccine programs that present particular challenges to the analyst. These include the development of the appropriate epidemiological models from which to estimate the costs and benefits; the accurate prediction of uptake rates; the incorporation of quality adjusted survival gains; and the inclusion of intangible but nonetheless important benefits and costs associated with infectious disease and vaccination. The estimation of marginal intervention costs presents specific difficulties, especially for multivalent vaccines and valuing costs and benefits over time is heavily influenced by the choice of discount rate, which is still a controversial topic. Developments in the next 5 years are likely to address all of these issues and result in more sophisticated and accurate models of vaccination programs.},

Objective is to compare trends in paediatric adenoidectomies and tympanostomy tube insertions for Norway and Finland from 1999 to 2005. Methods: National Finnish and Norwegian databases (STAKES and NPR) provided information on children between 0 and 7 years operated in the years 1999-2005. Surgical rates were viewed in the light of child density, age and gender, and compared bi-nationally. Results: Adenoidectomies were more common in Finland throughout the study period. Adenoidectomies in both countries decreased markedly from 1999 to 2005. The Finnish adenoidectomy rates were reduced from 212 to 133 per 10,000 children, equivalent Norwegian figures were 84 and 44 per 10,000 children. Tympanostomy tube insertions increased from 97 to 147 per 10,000 children in Finland in the same study period. In Norway the rates were more stable, 119 and 123 per 10,000 in 1999 and 2005, respectively. Peak-age for otitis media surgery was the second year of life in Finland, sixth in Norway. Boys were more frequently operated on in both countries. Conclusion: Our study confirmed differences in the approach to otitis media surgery and revealed a decreasing trend in adenoidectomies in both countries. Similar data from other countries is needed to confirm the latter. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After licensure of PCV13, there was an immediate drop in AOM caused by Spn vaccine serotypes and an increase in non-vaccine types 16, 21 and 35B. When NP co-colonization occurred, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) predominated over Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) to cause AOM, and NTHi and Spn both predominated over Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat). Transcriptome analysis of PBMCs identified unique signatures for NTHi AOM compared to Spn AOM.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of implementing guidelines, coupled with individual feedback, on antibiotic prescribing behaviour of primary care physicians in Switzerland. METHODS One hundred and forty general practices from a representative Swiss sentinel network of primary care physicians participated in this cluster-randomized prospective intervention study. The intervention consisted of providing guidelines on treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs), coupled with sustained, regular feedback on individual antibiotic prescription behaviour during 2 years. The main aims were: (i) to increase the percentage of prescriptions of penicillins for all RTIs treated with antibiotics; (ii) to increase the percentage of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prescriptions for all uncomplicated lower UTIs treated with antibiotics; (iii) to decrease the percentage of quinolone prescriptions for all cases of exacerbated COPD (eCOPD) treated with antibiotics; and (iv) to decrease the proportion of sinusitis and other upper RTIs treated with antibiotics. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01358916). RESULTS While the percentage of antibiotics prescribed for sinusitis or other upper RTIs and the percentage of quinolones prescribed for eCOPD did not differ between the intervention group and the control group, there was a significant increase in the percentage of prescriptions of penicillins for all RTIs treated with antibiotics [57{\%} versus 49{\%}, OR=1.42 (95{\%} CI 1.08-1.89), P=0.01] and in the percentage of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prescriptions for all uncomplicated lower UTIs treated with antibiotics [35{\%} versus 19{\%}, OR=2.16 (95{\%} CI 1.19-3.91), P=0.01] in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS In our setting, implementing guidelines, coupled with sustained individual feedback, was not able to reduce the proportion of sinusitis and other upper RTIs treated with antibiotics, but increased the use of recommended antibiotics for RTIs and UTIs, as defined by the guidelines.},

abstract = {Objective: This study aims to evaluate the costs and outcomes of offering the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Thailand compared to the current situation of no PCV vaccination. Methods: Two vaccination schedules were considered: two-dose primary series plus a booster dose (2. +. 1) and three-dose primary series plus a booster dose (3. +. 1). A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a societal perspective. A Markov simulation model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes for a lifetime horizon. Costs were collected and values were calculated for the year 2010. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Thai Baht (THB) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, with future costs and outcomes being discounted at 3{\%} per annum. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. Results: Under the base case-scenario of 2. +. 1 dose schedule and a five-year protection, without indirect vaccine effects, the ICER for PCV10 and PCV13 were THB 1,368,072 and THB 1,490,305 per QALY gained, respectively. With indirect vaccine effects, the ICER of PCV10 was THB 519,399, and for PCV13 was THB 527,378. The model was sensitive to discount rate, the change in duration of vaccine protection and the incidence of pneumonia for all age groups. Conclusions: At current prices, PCV10 and PCV13 are not cost-effective in Thailand. Inclusion of indirect vaccine effects substantially reduced the ICERs for both vaccines, but did not result in cost effectiveness. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:It is uncertain whether bridging anticoagulation is necessary for patients with atrial fibrillation who need an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure. We hypothesized that forgoing bridging anticoagulation would be noninferior to bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of perioperative arterial thromboembolism and would be superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding.$\backslash$nMETHODS:We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which, after perioperative interruption of warfarin therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive bridging anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (100 IU of dalteparin per kilogram of body weight) or matching placebo administered subcutaneously twice daily, from 3 days before the procedure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5 to 10 days after the procedure. Warfarin treatment was stopped 5 days before the procedure and was resumed within 24 hours after the procedure. Follow-up of patients continued for 30 days after the procedure. The primary outcomes were arterial thromboembolism (stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack) and major bleeding.$\backslash$nRESULTS:In total, 1884 patients were enrolled, with 950 assigned to receive no bridging therapy and 934 assigned to receive bridging therapy. The incidence of arterial thromboembolism was 0.4{\%} in the no-bridging group and 0.3{\%} in the bridging group (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -0.6 to 0.8; P=0.01 for noninferiority). The incidence of major bleeding was 1.3{\%} in the no-bridging group and 3.2{\%} in the bridging group (relative risk, 0.41; 95{\%} CI, 0.20 to 0.78; P=0.005 for superiority).$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:In patients with atrial fibrillation who had warfarin treatment interrupted for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of major bleeding.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is estimated to cause 2 million deaths every year in children. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important cause of severe pneumonia. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a nine-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children. METHODS: We undertook a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in eastern Gambia. Children age 6-51 weeks were randomly allocated three doses of either pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (n=8718) or placebo (8719), with intervals of at least 25 days between doses. Our primary outcome was first episode of radiological pneumonia. Secondary endpoints were clinical or severe clinical pneumonia, invasive pneumococcal disease, and all-cause admissions. Analyses were per protocol and intention to treat. FINDINGS: 529 children assigned vaccine and 568 allocated placebo were not included in the per-protocol analysis. Results of per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were similar. By per-protocol analysis, 333 of 8189 children given vaccine had an episode of radiological pneumonia compared with 513 of 8151 who received placebo. Pneumococcal vaccine efficacy was 37{\%} (95{\%} CI 27-45) against first episode of radiological pneumonia. First episodes of clinical pneumonia were reduced overall by 7{\%} (95{\%} CI 1-12). Efficacy of the conjugate vaccine was 77{\%} (51-90) against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes, 50{\%} (21-69) against disease caused by all serotypes, and 15{\%} (7-21) against all-cause admissions. We also found an efficacy of 16{\%} (3-28) against mortality. 110 serious adverse events arose in children given the pneumococcal vaccine compared with 131 in those who received placebo. INTERPRETATION: In this rural African setting, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has high efficacy against radiological pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease, and can substantially reduce admissions and improve child survival. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines should be made available to African infants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: During 1996 to 2000, Alaska Native children aged {\textless}5 years from Yukon Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) had invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) rates 10-fold higher than non-Alaska Native children (547/100,000/yr versus 56/100,000/yr). After 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduction, IPD rates decreased to 148 per 100,000 during 2001 to 2004, increasing to 426 per 100,000 during 2005 to 2007 due to non-vaccine serotype disease. In 2009, we evaluated safety, immunogenicity and impact of 13-valent PCV (PCV13) in YKD children. METHODS: In a prelicensure open-label clinical trial, eligible YKD children aged {\textless}5 years were offered PCV13 as appropriate for age and prior PCV7 history. PCV13 impact was assessed using existing Alaska-wide IPD surveillance. Serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal IgG levels were measured postinfant series and posttoddler dose in a subset of subjects. Adverse events and serious adverse events were collected in all; local reactions and systemic events were collected in toddlers. All YKD children were offered licensed PCV13 when it became available. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-two subjects received PCV13 during the clinical trial and 3342 postlicensure (April 2010 to August 2011). Adverse events were typically mild, or generally consistent with common childhood illnesses. IgG levels following PCV13 were similar to other populations. In YKD children aged {\textless}5 years, 52 IPD cases (31 PCV13-serotype) occurred during 2005 to 2008 (399.0/100,000/yr) versus 9 (7 PCV13-serotype) during January 2009 to August 2011 (106.7/100,000/yr; P {\textless} 0.001). No PCV13-serotype cases occurred among PCV13 recipients (3680 person follow-up years). CONCLUSIONS: PCV13-serotype IPD incidence declined significantly after PCV13 introduction. Although non-PCV13-serotype IPD also declined significantly, absence of PCV13-serotype IPD in children who received PCV13 suggests a protective vaccine effect.},

Ongoing surveillance since 1995 of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Oxfordshire, UK, allowed assessment of the impact of vaccine intervention. The vaccine significantly reduced IPD among the target group, children under 2 years of age; incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.62 (95 {\%} CI 0.43-0.90) (P=0.008) comparing the 3 years pre- and post-implementation with a residual incidence of 22.4/100 000 children. The reduction was even greater when comparing 11 years pre- with the 3 years post-implementation of vaccine; IRR=0.53 (0.39-0.70) (P{\textless}0.0001). There was a marked direct effect of the vaccine evidenced by substantial reductions in the seven serotypes contained in the vaccine. There was also a clear reduction in IPD for those serotypes contained in the vaccine among those older than 2 years when comparing both the 3 and 11 year pre-PCV7 time periods, with IRR=0.57 (0.47-0.69) (P{\textless}0.0001) and IRR=0.50 (0.43-0.58) (P{\textless}0.0001), respectively, indicating a strong herd effect.

abstract = {Background: There are scare data about bacterial etiology and the antibiotic susceptibility, serotype distribution and molecular characteristics of pneumococci in children with acute otitis media (AOM) in China. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in Suzhou University Affiliated Children's Hospital. All children under 18 years of age diagnosed as AOM and with spontaneous otorrhea were offered enrollment, and collection of middle ear fluid was then cultured for bacterial pathogens. The antibiotic susceptibility, serotypes, macrolide resistance genes and sequence types of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were identified. Results: From January 2011 to December 2013, a total of 229 cases of AOM with spontaneous otorrhea were identified; of these, 159 (69.4{\%}) middle ear fluid specimens were tested positive for bacterial pathogens. The leading cause was S. pneumoniae (47.2{\%}), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.8{\%}) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.4{\%}). The antibiotic resistance rates of S. pneumoniae isolates to erythromycin were 99.1{\%}, and the nonsusceptible rate to penicillin was 54.6{\%}. The most common serotypes identified were 19A (45.1{\%}) and 19F (35.4{\%}). The coverage against PCV7 serotypes for this outcome was 56.1{\%} and of PCV13 was 97.6{\%}. The macrolide resistance was mainly mediated by both ermB and mefA/E genes (88.6{\%}). The CC271 was the major clonal complex identified. Conclusions: S. pneumoniae was a leading cause for AOM in children in Suzhou, China. Antibiotics resistance rates of S. pneumoniae were high and mainly due to the spread of CC271 clonal complex.},

Carriers of Types 6A and 19A penicillin-resistant pneumococci, resistant to antibiotic concentrations ranging between 0.12 and 4 microgram per milliliter were found in 29 per cent of 543 pediatric patients and 2 per cent of 434 hospital staff members. Multiply resistant Type 19A strains, resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, were isolated from 128 carriers, and were responsible for bacteremia in four patients. Isolates from 40 other carriers were resistant to penicillin alone or to penicillin and chloramphenicol or to penicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline.

abstract = {Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common bacterial infection in children and has a very varied clinical spectrum, ranging from spontaneous resolutions to serious complications. The effect of antibiotics in AOM depends on the chosen outcome, but has been shown to reduce pain somewhat, and have a greater beneficial effect in severe cases of AOM. Today, not all episodes of AOM are treated with antibiotics, but most countries have issued guidelines that include an option of watchful waiting in many cases. Prevention of AOM reaches from modification of environmental risk factors to vaccinations and surgery. Conjugate pneumococcal vaccines and influenza vaccines have been shown to somewhat reduce the number of AOM episodes in different groups of children. Grommets, with or without adenoidectomy, are effective at least during the first 6 months after surgery.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization especially in young children with respiratory tract infections (RTI). Patterns of circulating RSV genotypes can provide a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of RSV infection. We retrospectively analyzed the genetic diversity of RSV infection in hospitalized children with acute RTI admitted to University Hospital Heidelberg/Germany between October 2012 and April 2013. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were routinely obtained in 240 children younger than 2 years of age who presented with clinical symptoms of upper or lower RTI. We analyzed NPAs via PCR and sequence analysis of the second variable region of the RSV G gene coding for the attachment glycoprotein. We obtained medical records reviewing routine clinical data. RSV was detected in 134/240 children. In RSV-positive patients the most common diagnosis was bronchitis/bronchiolitis (75.4{\%}). The mean duration of hospitalization was longer in RSV-positive compared to RSV-negative patients (3.5 vs. 5.1 days; p{\textless}0.01). RSV-A was detected in 82.1{\%}, RSV-B in 17.9{\%} of all samples. Phylogenetic analysis of 112 isolates revealed that the majority of RSV-A strains (65{\%}) belonged to the novel ON1 genotype containing a 72-nucleotide duplication. However, genotype ON1 was not associated with a more severe course of illness when taking basic clinical/laboratory parameters into account. Molecular characterization of RSV confirms the co-circulation of multiple genotypes of subtype RSV-A and RSV-B. The duplication in the G gene of genotype ON1 might have an effect on the rapid spread of this emerging RSV strain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to estimate the population effect of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on rates of acute otitis media-related ambulatory visits and antibiotic prescriptions for {\textless}2-year-old children enrolled in private insurance plans. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a defined population by using the 1997-2004 MarketScan databases, which included an average of {\textgreater}500,000 person-years of observations for children {\textless}2 years of age. Trends in rates of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-coded ambulatory visits and antibiotic prescriptions attributable to acute otitis media were evaluated, and the national direct medical expenditures for these outcomes were estimated. RESULTS: In a comparison of 2004 with 1997-1999 (baseline period), rates of ambulatory visits and antibiotic prescriptions attributable to acute otitis media decreased from 2173 to 1244 visits per 1000 person-years (42.7{\%} reduction) and from 1244 to 722 prescriptions per 1000 person-years (41.9{\%} reduction), respectively. Total, estimated, national direct medical expenditures for acute otitis media-related ambulatory visits and antibiotic prescriptions for children {\textless}2 years of age decreased from an average of {\$}1.41 billion during 1997 to 1999 to {\$}0.95 billion in 2004 (32.3{\%} reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Acute otitis media-related health care utilization and associated antibiotic prescriptions for privately insured young children decreased more than expected (on the basis of efficacy estimates in prelicensure clinical trials) after the introduction of routine 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine immunization. Although other factors, such as clinical practice guidelines to reduce antibiotic use, might have contributed to the observed trend, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may play an important role in reducing the burden of acute otitis media, resulting in substantial savings in medical care costs.},

abstract = {The appropriate development of a model begins with understanding the problem that is being represented. The aim of this article was to provide a series of consensus-based best practices regarding the process of model conceptualization. For the purpose of this series of articles, we consider the development of models whose purpose is to inform medical decisions and health-related resource allocation questions. We specifically divide the conceptualization process into two distinct components: the conceptualization of the problem, which converts knowledge of the health care process or decision into a representation of the problem, followed by the conceptualization of the model itself, which matches the attributes and characteristics of a particular modeling type with the needs of the problem being represented. Recommendations are made regarding the structure of the modeling team, agreement on the statement of the problem, the structure, perspective, and target population of the model, and the interventions and outcomes represented. Best practices relating to the specific characteristics of model structure and which characteristics of the problem might be most easily represented in a specific modeling method are presented. Each section contains a number of recommendations that were iterated among the authors, as well as among the wider modeling taskforce, jointly set up by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the Society for Medical Decision Making.},

However, the scope of such analyses is often limited, even though techniques have been developed for presenting the effects of methodological, structural, and parameter uncertainty on model results. To help bring these techniques into mainstream use, the authors present a step-by-step guide that offers an integrated approach to account for different kinds of uncertainty in the same model, along with a checklist for assessing the way in which uncertainty has been incorporated. The guide also addresses special situations such as when a source of uncertainty is difficult to parameterize, resources are limited for an ideal exploration of uncertainty, or evidence to inform the model is not available or not reliable. METHODS for identifying the sources of uncertainty that influence results most are also described. Besides guiding analysts, the guide and checklist may be useful to decision makers who need to assess how well uncertainty has been accounted for in a decision-analytic model before using the results to make a decision.},

abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) are associated with substantial burden in adults (≥50 years). Moreover, adults with vascular, metabolic or respiratory diseases have been shown to have a 3-6 times higher risk of IPD when compared with their healthy controls. These persons at higher risk are likely to benefit most from pneumococcal vaccinations. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was recently introduced to prevent the 13 most prevalent serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. The objective of this study was to estimate the expected 5-year economic impact of targeted PCV13 vaccination compared with no vaccination in Finnish adults (≥50 years) at moderate or high risk for IPD.

METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to predict the impact of PCV13 vaccination in terms of the costs and IPD events avoided for years 2012-2016.

RESULTS: Approximately 35{\%} of the 2.2 million Finns over 50 years of age can be considered to be at moderate or high risk for IPD because of underlying chronic medical conditions. Vaccination of these people with PCV13 could provide an estimated net budget savings of about €218 million compared with the current no-vaccination situation over the next 5 years. Among the risk groups considered, the largest absolute net savings (€66.2 million) could be expected to be obtained by vaccinating people with heart disease, due to its high prevalence in the target population.

CONCLUSION: In Finland, the immunization with PCV13 vaccine, of adults (≥50 years) at moderate and high risk of IPD, is estimated to lead to substantial cost savings in the 5 years after vaccination.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the heptavalent CRM197 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes and to determine the effectiveness of this vaccine against clinical episodes of otitis media. METHODS The Wyeth Lederle Heptavalent CRM197 (PCV) was given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 15 months of age in a double blind trial; 37,868 children were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or meningococcus type C CRM197 conjugate. The primary study outcome was invasive disease caused by vaccine serotype. Other outcomes included overall impact on invasive disease regardless of serotype, effectiveness against clinical otitis media visits and episodes, impact against frequent and severe otitis media and ventilatory tube placement. In addition the serotype-specific efficacy against otitis media was estimated in an analysis of spontaneously draining ears. RESULTS In the interim analysis in August, 1998, 17 of the 17 cases of invasive disease caused by vaccine serotype in fully vaccinated children and 5 of 5 of partially vaccinated cases occurred in the control group for a vaccine efficacy of 100{\%}. Blinded case ascertainment was continued until April, 1999. As of that time 40 fully vaccinated cases of invasive disease caused by vaccine serotype had been identified, all but 1 in controls for an efficacy of 97.4{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 82.7 to 99.9{\%}), and 52 cases, all but 3 in controls in the intent-to-treat analysis for an efficacy of 93.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 79.6 to 98.5{\%}). There was no evidence of any increase of disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes. Efficacy for otitis media against visits, episodes, frequent otitis and ventilatory tube placement was 8.9, 7.0, 9.3 and 20.1{\%} with P {\textless} 0.04 for all. In the analysis of spontaneously draining ears, serotype-specific effectiveness was 66.7{\%}. CONCLUSION This heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate appears to be highly effective in preventing invasive disease in young children and to have a significant impact on otitis media.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED We compared the microbiology of middle ear fluid (MEF) in two cohorts of children having ventilation tube (VT) insertion; the first in the era of 7-valent Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and the second following introduction of the ten-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PHiD-CV10). METHODS During 2011 (Phase 1) and again in 2014 (Phase 2) MEF and NP samples from 325 children and 319 children were taken at the time of VT insertion. A matched comparison group had NP swabs collected with 137 children (Phase 1) and 154 (Phase 2). Culture was performed on all NP and MEF samples with further molecular identification of Haemophilus species, serotyping of S. pneumoniae, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on all MEF samples. RESULTS In Phase 2 immunisation coverage with ⩾3 doses of PHiD-CV10 was 93{\%}. The rate and ratios of culture and molecular detection of the 3 main otopathogens was unchanged between Phase 1 and Phase 2 in both MEF and NP. Haemophilus influenzae was cultured in one quarter and detected by PCR in 53{\%} of MEF samples in both time periods. S. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were cultured in up to 13{\%} and detected by PCR in 27{\%} and 40{\%} respectively of MEF samples. H. influenzae was the most common organism isolated from NP samples (61{\%}) in the children undergoing VT surgery whilst M. catarrhalis (49{\%}) was the most common in the non-otitis prone group. 19A was the most prominent S. pneumoniae serotype in both MEF and NP samples in Phase 2. Of Haemophilus isolates, 95{\%} were confirmed to be non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) over both time periods. CONCLUSION Following implementation of PHiD-CV10 in New Zealand, there has been no significant change in the 3 major otopathogens in NP or MEF in children with established ear disease. For these children non-typeable H. influenzae remains the dominant otopathogen detected.},

abstract = {We previously reported 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) efficacy in a double-blind randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00466947) against various diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM). Here, we provide further analyses. In the Panamanian subset, 7,359 children were randomized (1:1) to receive PHiD-CV or control vaccine at age 2/4/6 and 15-18 months. Of these, 2,000 had nasopharyngeal swabs collected. AOM cases were captured when parents sought medical attention for children with AOM symptoms; surveillance was enhanced approximately 2 y into the study through regular telephone calls or home visits by study personnel, who advised parents to visit the clinic if their child had AOM symptoms. Mean follow-up was 31.4 months. Clinical AOM (C-AOM) cases were assessed by physicians and confirmed by otorhinolaryngologists. Middle ear fluid samples, taken from children with C-AOM after specific informed consent, and nasopharyngeal samples were cultured for pathogen identification. For 7,359 children, 2,574 suspected AOM cases were assessed by a primary healthcare physician; 649 cases were C-AOM cases as per protocol definition. From the 503 MEF samples collected, 158 resulted in a positive culture. In the intent-to-treat cohort (7,214 children), PHiD-CV showed VE against first C-AOM (24.0{\%} [95{\%} CI: 8.7, 36.7]) and bacterial (B-AOM) episodes (48.0{\%} [20.3, 66.1]) in children {\textless}24 months, which declined thereafter with age. Pre-booster VE against C-AOM was 30.7{\%} [12.9, 44.9]; post-booster, -6.7{\%} [-36.4, 16.6]. PHiD-CV VE was 17.7{\%} [-6.1, 36.2] against moderate and 32.7{\%} [-20.5, 62.4] against severe C-AOM. VE against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal NPC was 31.2{\%} [5.3, 50.3] 3 months post-booster, and 25.6{\%} [12.7, 36.7] across all visits. NTHi colonization rates were low and no significant reduction was observed. PHiD-CV showed efficacy against C-AOM and B-AOM in children younger than 24 months, and reduced vaccine-serotype NPC.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae, a natural constituent of nasopharyngeal flora in young children, is an important pathogen involved in various respiratory and invasive infections. Extensive antibiotic use has reduced morbidity and mortality associated with pneumococcal infections but has also led to non-susceptibility of some serotypes. Implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programmes results in reduced antibiotic usage and decreased antibiotic resistance. In California, the Kaiser Permanente study demonstrated a 7.8{\%} reduction in otitis media (OM) visits from 1995 to 1998 following seven-valent PCV (PCV7) administration while decreasing antibiotic prescriptions by 5.4{\%}. An Israeli study in day-care centres recorded a 17{\%} reduction in antibiotic use in children given nine-valent PCV. Similarly, a US study showed a 41.9{\%} reduction in antibiotic prescriptions for acute OM (AOM) when comparing pre-PCV7 to post-PCV7 utilization. In France, a comprehensive PCV7 vaccination programme showed a decrease in antibiotic treatment of AOM from 51.8{\%} to 40.9{\%} over 2 years. Carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci dropped from 15.4{\%} to 6.7{\%}. A similar reduction from 47.7{\%} to 30.4{\%} was seen in penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci. Other studies demonstrated a shift in serotype distribution. Carriage of vaccine-serotype pneumococci declined from 44.3{\%} to 28.9{\%} over a 2-year period, while carriage of non-vaccine serotypes increased from 9.6{\%} to 15.8{\%}. During 6 years of follow-up surveillance, prevalence of serotype 19A increased from 8.6{\%} to 12.6{\%}, while highly penicillin-resistant strains decreased from 15.6{\%} to 1.1{\%}; no new serotype emergence was observed. Implementation of PCV programmes should be accompanied by supportive education on restricting the use of antibiotics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: TNO-AZL Preschool Quality of Life Questionnaire (TAPQOL) is one of the few instruments designed to assess health-related quality of life in preschool children but its applicability to otolaryngology is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We studied a consecutive series of children aged 1 to 5 years referred to hospital with recurrent sore throats, recurrent acute otitis media, or otitis media with effusion. RESULTS: TAPQOL domain scores were not influenced by age, sex, or socio-economic class, but correlated with markers of disease severity (frequency of sore throat or pyrexia, time off school), ear-related handicap (assessed with the OM6 questionnaire), and other measures of health-related quality of life (visual analogue scale, 5-point rating scale and the Health Utilities Index mark III). Comparison with published data from healthy children suggests that these common otolaryngologic problems have a large impact on a child's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: TAPQOL seems to be appropriate for use in this context. Marked ceiling effects in some domains, however, may limit their sensitivity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The UK introduced the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into the national vaccination program in September 2006. Previous modelling assumed that the likely impact of PCV7 on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) would be similar to the US experience with PCV7. However, recent surveillance data show a more rapid replacement of PCV7 IPD cases by non-PCV7 IPD cases than was seen in the US. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A previous model of pneumococcal vaccination was re-parameterised using data on vaccine coverage and IPD from England and Wales between 2006 and 2009. Disease incidence was adjusted for the increasing trend in reported IPD cases prior to vaccination. Using this data we estimated that individuals carrying PCV7 serotypes have much higher protection (96{\%};95{\%} CI 72{\%}-100{\%}) against acquisition of NVT carriage than the 15{\%} previously estimated from US data, which leads to greater replacement. However, even with this level of replacement, the annual number of IPD cases may be 560 (95{\%} CI, -100 to 1230) lower ten years after vaccine introduction compared to what it may have been without vaccination. A particularly marked fall of 39{\%} in children under 15 years by 2015/6 is predicted. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that PCV7 vaccination could result in a decrease in overall invasive pneumococcal disease, particularly in children, even in an environment of rapid replacement with non-PCV7 serotypes within 5 years of vaccine introduction at high coverage.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Pneumococci are common colonizer, especially of children, and cocolonization of different serotypes is an important factor for intraspecies genetic exchange. The aim of this study was to analyze pneumococcal carriage and serotype distribution in unvaccinated healthy children in Iceland and compare conventional culture methods and molecular methods using DNA extracted directly from the samples. METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 514 children aged 2-6 year attending day care centers in Reykjavik in 2009. The swabs were selectively cultured for pneumococci and the isolates serotyped using latex agglutination. DNA was also extracted directly from the swabs and serotyped using a multiplex PCR panel designed to detect vaccine serotypes and the most commonly carried non-vaccine serotypes. RESULT Pneumococcal carriage was detected in 391 (76.1{\%}) of the children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in 371 (72.2{\%}) using conventional methods. Cocolonization was detected in 92 (23.5{\%}) of the carriers when PCR method was used and in 30 (8.1{\%}) when conventional methods were used, detecting 500 and 401 strains, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). The most common serotypes were 23F, 19A, 6B, 6A and 19F, rates 13-8{\%}. The number of isolates of serotypes included in the 10-valent and 13-valent vaccines and detected by PCR were 234 (58.4{\%}) and 363 (90.5{\%}), respectively and by conventional methods 186 (46.4{\%}) and 293 (73.1{\%}), respectively. CONCLUSION Cocolonization was detected in a fourth of the children carrying pneumococci using DNA extracted directly from nasopharyngeal swabs. The rate of carriage was very high, but no serotype dominated, and the children were commonly colonized by vaccine serotypes, especially cocolonized children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare, from a Chinese societal perspective, the projected health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of adding pneumococcal conjugate heptavalent vaccine (PCV-7) to the routine compulsory child immunization schedule.

METHODS: A decision-tree model, with data and assumptions adapted for relevance to China, was developed to project the health outcomes of PCV-7 vaccination (compared with no vaccination) over a 5-year period as well as a lifetime. The vaccinated birth cohort included 16,000,000 children in China. A 2 + 1 dose schedule at US{\$}136.51 per vaccine dose was used in the base-case analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model. The impact of a net indirect effect (herd immunity) was evaluated. Outcomes are presented in terms of the saved disease burden, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

RESULTS: In a Chinese birth cohort, a PCV-7 vaccination program would reduce the number of pneumococcus-related infections by at least 32{\%} and would prevent 2,682 deaths in the first 5 years of life, saving {\$}1,190 million in total costs and gaining an additional 9,895 QALYs (discounted by 3{\%}). The incremental cost per QALY was estimated to be {\$}530,354. When herd immunity was taken into account, the cost per QALY was estimated to be {\$}95,319. The robustness of the model was influenced mainly by the PCV-7 cost per dose, effectiveness herd immunity and incidence of pneumococcal diseases. With and without herd immunity, the break-even costs in China were {\$}29.05 and {\$}25.87, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Compulsory routine infant vaccination with PCV-7 is projected to substantially reduce pneumococcal disease morbidity, mortality, and related costs in China. However, a universal vaccination program with PCV-7 is not cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold that is currently recommended for China by the World Health Organization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Otitis media (OM) is common in early childhood. Streptococcus pneumoniae caused approximately 30{\%}-60{\%} of episodes before the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) era. The 7-valent PCV (PCV7) was introduced to the Israeli National Immunization Plan in July 2009, and was gradually replaced by the 13-valent PCV (PCV13) starting in November 2010. We aimed at assessing the impact of PCV7/PCV13 sequential introduction on pneumococcal and overall OM necessitating middle ear fluid culture in children aged {\textless}2 years in southern Israel. METHODS: This was a prospective, population-based, active surveillance. Our medical center is the only one in the region, enabling incidence calculation. All pneumococcal episodes submitted for culture between July 2004 and June 2013 were included. Three subperiods were defined: pre-PCV, PCV7, and PCV13. RESULTS: Overall, 6122 OM episodes were recorded, and 1893 were pneumococcal. Compared with the pre-PCV period, OM caused by PCV7 plus serotype 6A and the 5 additional PCV13 serotypes (5VT : 1, 3, 5, 7F, 19A) decreased by 96{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively (incidence rate ratios [IRRs], 0.04 [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, .02-.08] and 0.15 [95{\%} CI, .07-.30], respectively) in a 2-step pattern: In the PCV7 period, only OM caused by PCV7 + 6A serotypes was decreased; in the PCV13 period, 5VT OM rates decreased, along with an additional PCV7 + 6A OM reduction. A nonsignificant increase in non-PCV13 serotype OM was observed (IRR, 1.07 [95{\%} CI, .72-1.58]). In total, 77{\%} and 60{\%} reductions of all-pneumococcal and all-cause OM incidences, respectively, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial 2-step reduction of pneumococcal OM rates, with near-elimination of PCV13 disease, was observed shortly after PCV7/PCV13 introduction.},

We assessed the ecological association between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance rates using Spearman's correlation coefficients. FINDINGS Prescription of antibiotics in primary care in Europe varied greatly; the highest rate was in France (32.2 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily) and the lowest was in the Netherlands (10.0 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily). We noted a shift from the old narrow-spectrum antibiotics to the new broad-spectrum antibiotics. We also recorded striking seasonal fluctuations with heightened winter peaks in countries with high yearly use of antibiotics. We showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance in high consuming countries, probably related to the higher consumption in southern and eastern Europe than in northern Europe. INTERPRETATION These data might provide a useful method for assessing public-health strategies that aim to reduce antibiotic use and resistance levels.},

abstract = {Although randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) are critical to establish efficacy of vaccines at the time of licensure, important remaining questions about vaccine effectiveness (VE)-used here to include individual-level measures and population-wide impact of vaccine programmes-can only be answered once the vaccine is in use, from observational studies. However, such studies are inherently at risk for bias. Using a causal framework and illustrating with examples, we review newer approaches to detecting and avoiding confounding and selection bias in three major classes of observational study design: cohort, case-control and ecological studies. Studies of influenza VE, especially in seniors, are an excellent demonstration of the challenges of detecting and reducing such bias, and so we use influenza VE as a running example. We take a fresh look at the time-trend studies often dismissed as 'ecological'. Such designs are the only observational study design that can measure the overall effect of a vaccination programme [indirect (herd) as well as direct effects], and are in fact already an important part of the evidence base for several vaccines currently in use. Despite the great strides towards more robust observational study designs, challenges lie ahead for evaluating best practices for achieving robust unbiased results from observational studies. This is critical for evaluation of national and global vaccine programme effectiveness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of heptavalent protein-polysaccharide pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has been associated with decreases in PCV7-type invasive pneumococcal disease and nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage in children. Vaccine use has also indirectly decreased the rate of invasive disease in adults, presumably through decreased transmission of pneumococci from vaccinated children to adults. METHODS: We conducted NP carriage surveys in 8 villages in Alaska in 1998-2004. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were characterized by serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility. We analyzed trends in serotype distribution, antibiotic resistance, and factors associated with adult carriage of PCV7-serotype pneumococci before and after the introduction of PCV7 in 2001. RESULTS: We collected 15,598 NP swabs; overall, 52{\%} of adults living in the villages surveyed participated in the colonization study. The proportion of adult carriers with PCV7-type pneumococcal carriage decreased from 28{\%} of carriers in 1998-2000 to 4.5{\%} of carriers in 2004 (P{\textless}.0001). Among adults, the proportion of colonizing isolates that were resistant to penicillin decreased from 13{\%} in 1998-2000 to 6{\%} in 2004 (P=.05), whereas the percentage of isolates with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin increased from 12{\%} in 1998-2000 to 19{\%} in 2004 (P{\textless}.01). Adults were more likely to carry PCV7-type pneumococci if they lived with a child {\textless}5 years old or if they lived with a child who had not been age-appropriately vaccinated with PCV7. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric vaccination with PCV7 has resulted in decreased PCV7-type pneumococcal carriage among adults and helps to explain recent decreases in the rate of PCV7-type invasive pneumococcal disease among adults.},

Different strains of the novel RSV-A genotype ON1, first identified in Ontario (Canada) in December 2010, were detected for the first time in Italy in the following 2011/12 epidemic season. They bear an insertion of 24 amino acids in the G glycoprotein as well as amino acid changes likely to change antigenicity. By early 2013, ON1 strains had spread so efficiently that they had nearly replaced other RSV-A strains. Notably, the RSV peak in the 2012/13 epidemic season occurred earlier and, compared with the previous two seasons, influenza-like illnesses diagnoses were more frequent in younger children; bronchiolitis cases had a less severe clinical course. Nonetheless, the ON1-associated intensive care unit admission rate was similar, if not greater, than that attributable to other RSV-A strains. Improving RSV surveillance would allow timely understanding of the epidemiological and clinicopathological features of the novel RSV-A genotype.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: The Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Denmark are neighbouring Nordic countries with great ethnic, cultural, and political similarities and are relatively homogeneous. Important information about prescribing practices can be obtained by comparing the antibacterial use in these countries. The objective was to describe, compare, and analyse the use of systemic antibacterial agents in these countries during the y 1999-2011. Methods: Data were obtained from the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Denmark on systemic antibacterial use and expressed in defined daily dosages (DDD). Prescription data were also obtained for specific age groups. Results: The total antibacterial use for the y 1999-2011 varied markedly between the 3 countries, with a mean use of 21.8 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day (DID) in Iceland, 17.7 in the Faroe Islands, and 16.3 in Denmark. The total use remained fairly constant over the years in the Faroe Islands and Iceland, whereas in Denmark it increased gradually from 13.5 DID in 1999 to 19.5 DID in 2011. The higher use in Iceland can be explained by much higher consumption of tetracyclines. There was also considerable variation in the use of individual penicillins and macrolides between the countries. Conclusions: Despite the great ethnic and cultural similarities of these 3 countries, we found marked differences in total antibacterial use and important differences in the use of individual antibacterials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although effective in preventing pneumococcal disease, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is the most expensive vaccine on the routinely recommended pediatric schedule in the United States. We examined the cost-effectiveness of switching from 4 total doses to 3 total doses by removing the third dose in the primary series in the United States. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model following a single birth cohort of 4.3 million to calculate societal cost savings and increased disease burden from removing the 6-month dose of PCV13. Based on modified estimates of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine from randomized trials and observational studies, we assumed that vaccine effectiveness under the 2 schedules is identical for the first 6 months of life and largely similar after administration of the 12- to 15-month booster dose. RESULTS: Removing the third dose of PCV13 would annually save {\$}500 million (in 2011{\$}) but would also result in an estimated 2.5 additional deaths among inpatients with pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease. Such dose removal would also result in 261,000 estimated otitis media and 12,000 estimated pneumonia cases annually. These additional illnesses could be prevented through modest increases in coverage. Overall, societal savings per additional life-year lost would be ∼{\$}6 million. When nonfatal outcomes are also considered, savings would range from {\$}143,000 to {\$}4 million per additional quality adjusted life-year lost, depending on the assumptions used for otitis media. CONCLUSIONS: Sizable societal cost savings and a moderate pneumococcal disease increase could be expected from removing the PCV13 primary series' third dose.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first step in a bacterial disease is the establishment of nasopharyngeal carriage.

METHODS: We conducted a birth cohort study to identify factors associated with colonization in healthy children and evaluate the serotype distributions and resistances of Streptococcus pneumoniae/Haemophilus influenzae. Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained from 349 subjects at 5 time points coinciding with health checkups (4, 7, 10, 18 and 36 months).

RESULTS: A total of 551 S. pneumoniae (penicillin resistance rate: 46.3{\%}) and 301 H. influenzae (ampicillin resistance rate: 44.5{\%}) isolates were obtained from 1654 samples. In this study, 47.5{\%} and 60.9{\%} of S. pneumoniae isolates were included in the serotypes of 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, respectively. Analyzing by Cox proportional hazards models, cohabiting older sibling(s) attending day-care (hazard ratios: 2.064-3.518, P {\textless} 0.001) and an early start of day-care attendance by the subjects themselves (2.259-2.439, P {\textless} 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of early colonization regardless of their susceptibility. Recent exposure to antimicrobials was also significantly associated with increased risk of colonization (odds ratios: 2.032-2.999, P {\textless} 0.001) but not with resistance rates. This data indicated that introduction of appropriate antimicrobial usage in areas of overuse of antimicrobials could contribute to lower colonization of S. pneumoniae/H. influenzae, resulting in a decrease in the absolute number of resistant isolates.

CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to control transmission at day-care centers or from older sibling(s) as well as appropriate use of antimicrobials are essential for reducing colonization and the absolute number of resistant isolates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2015 provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) in 195 countries. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 25 years and shows how the burden of LRI has changed in people of all ages. METHODS We estimated LRI mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using a modelling platform shared across most causes of death in the GBD 2015 study called the Cause of Death Ensemble model. We modelled LRI morbidity, including incidence and prevalence, using a meta-regression platform called DisMod-MR. We estimated aetiologies for LRI using two different counterfactual approaches, the first for viral pathogens, which incorporates the aetiology-specific risk of LRI and the prevalence of the aetiology in LRI episodes, and the second for bacterial pathogens, which uses a vaccine-probe approach. We used the Socio-demographic Index, which is a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility, to assess trends in LRI-related mortality. The two leading risk factors for LRI disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), childhood undernutrition and air pollution, were used in a decomposition analysis to establish the relative contribution of changes in LRI DALYs. FINDINGS In 2015, we estimated that LRIs caused 2{\textperiodcentered}74 million deaths (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 2{\textperiodcentered}50 million to 2{\textperiodcentered}86 million) and 103{\textperiodcentered}0 million DALYs (95{\%} UI 96{\textperiodcentered}1 million to 109{\textperiodcentered}1 million). LRIs have a disproportionate effect on children younger than 5 years, responsible for 704 000 deaths (95{\%} UI 651 000-763 000) and 60.6 million DALYs (95{\`{U}}I 56{\textperiodcentered}0-65{\textperiodcentered}6). Between 2005 and 2015, the number of deaths due to LRI decreased by 36{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (95{\%} UI 31{\textperiodcentered}6 to 42{\textperiodcentered}0) in children younger than 5 years, and by 3{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (95{\%} UI -0{\textperiodcentered}4 to 6{\textperiodcentered}9) in all ages. Pneumococcal pneumonia caused 55{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} of LRI deaths in all ages, totalling 1 517 388 deaths (95{\%} UI 857 940-2 183 791). Between 2005 and 2015, improvements in air pollution exposure were responsible for a 4{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} reduction in LRI DALYs and improvements in childhood undernutrition were responsible for an 8{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} reduction. INTERPRETATION LRIs are the leading infectious cause of death and the fifth-leading cause of death overall; they are the second-leading cause of DALYs. At the global level, the burden of LRIs has decreased dramatically in the last 10 years in children younger than 5 years, although the burden in people older than 70 years has increased in many regions. LRI remains a largely preventable disease and cause of death, and continued efforts to decrease indoor and ambient air pollution, improve childhood nutrition, and scale up the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children and adults will be essential in reducing the global burden of LRI.

The proportion of cases caused by non-vaccine-related serotypes (NVS) increased from 21{\%} to 43.7{\%} (OR 2.9, 95{\%} CI 1.2-7, p 0.01). IPD was diagnosed in seven vaccinated children, six of whom were infected by NVS. There was a trend of diminishing prevalence of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in 2002-2004. The incidence of empyema increased from 1.7 to 8.5/100,000 (OR 4.5, 95{\%} CI 0.91-18, p 0.06). The rate of vaccination ranged from 4.8{\%} to 34{\%}. It was concluded that the rates of IPD in this area did not decrease following the introduction of HPCV. The low uptake of vaccine and the greater proportion of colonisation/infection by NVS probably explain these findings. A trend of increasing empyema was also apparent. A decrease in the prevalence of penicillin and macrolide resistance paralleled the progressive uptake of vaccine.},

abstract = {Pneumonia remains the leading cause of childhood mortality and the most common reason for adult hospitalisation in low and middle income countries, despite advances in preventative and management strategies. In the last decade, pneumonia mortality in children has fallen to approximately 1.3 million cases in 2011, with most deaths occurring in low income countries. Important recent advances include more widespread implementation of protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type B and Streptococcus pneumoniae, implementation of case-management algorithms and better prevention and treatment of HIV. Determining the aetiology of pneumonia is challenging in the absence of reliable diagnostic tests. High uptake of new bacterial conjugate vaccines may impact on pneumonia burden, aetiology and empiric therapy but implementation in immunisation programmes in many low and middle income countries remains an obstacle. Widespread implementation of currently effective preventative and management strategies for pneumonia remains challenging in many low and middle income countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In South Africa, a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in 2009 with a three-dose schedule for infants at 6, 14, and 36 weeks of age; a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in 2011. In 2012, it was estimated that 81{\%} of 12-month-old children had received three doses of vaccine. We assessed the effect of vaccination on invasive pneumococcal disease. METHODS: We conducted national, active, laboratory-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease. We calculated the change in the incidence of the disease from a prevaccine (baseline) period (2005 through 2008) to postvaccine years 2011 and 2012, with a focus on high-risk age groups. RESULTS: Surveillance identified 35,192 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. The rates among children younger than 2 years of age declined from 54.8 to 17.0 cases per 100,000 person-years from the baseline period to 2012, including a decline from 32.1 to 3.4 cases per 100,000 person-years in disease caused by PCV7 serotypes (-89{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -92 to -86). Among children not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the estimated incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased by 85{\%} (95{\%} CI, -89 to -79), whereas disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes increased by 33{\%} (95{\%} CI, 15 to 48). Among adults 25 to 44 years of age, the rate of PCV7-serotype disease declined by 57{\%} (95{\%} CI, -63 to -50), from 3.7 to 1.6 cases per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of invasive pneumococcal disease among children in South Africa fell substantially by 2012. Reductions in the rates of disease caused by PCV7 serotypes among both children and adults most likely reflect the direct and indirect effects of vaccination.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Charlson comorbidity index is often used to control for confounding in research based on medical databases. There are few studies of the accuracy of the codes obtained from these databases. We examined the positive predictive value (PPV) of the ICD-10 diagnostic coding in the Danish National Registry of Patients (NRP) for the 19 Charlson conditions.

METHODS: Among all hospitalizations in Northern Denmark between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007 with a first-listed diagnosis of a Charlson condition in the NRP, we selected 50 hospital contacts for each condition. We reviewed discharge summaries and medical records to verify the NRP diagnoses, and computed the PPV as the proportion of confirmed diagnoses.

RESULTS: A total of 950 records were reviewed. The overall PPV for the 19 Charlson conditions was 98.0{\%} (95{\%} CI; 96.9, 98.8). The PPVs ranged from 82.0{\%} (95{\%} CI; 68.6{\%}, 91.4{\%}) for diabetes with diabetic complications to 100{\%} (one-sided 97.5{\%} CI; 92.9{\%}, 100{\%}) for congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, mild and severe liver disease, hemiplegia, renal disease, leukaemia, lymphoma, metastatic tumour, and AIDS.

CONCLUSION: The PPV of NRP coding of the Charlson conditions was consistently high.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Although common in children with tympanostomy tubes, the current incidence of tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) is uncertain. TTO is generally a sign of otitis media, when middle ear fluid drains through the tube. Predictors for otitis media are therefore suggested to have predictive value for the occurrence of TTO. OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of TTO and its predictors. METHODS We performed a cohort study, using a parental web-based questionnaire to retrospectively collect data on TTO episodes and its potential predictors from children younger than 10 years of age with tympanostomy tubes. RESULTS Of the 1,184 children included in analyses (total duration of time since tube placement was 768 person years with a mean of 7.8 months per child), 616 children (52{\%}) experienced one or more episodes of TTO. 137 children (12{\%}) had TTO within the calendar month of tube placement. 597 (50{\%}) children had one or more acute TTO episodes (duration {\textless}4 weeks) and 46 children (4{\%}) one or more chronic TTO episodes (duration ≥4 weeks). 146 children (12{\%}) experienced recurrent TTO episodes. Accounting for time since tube placement, 67{\%} of children developed one or more TTO episodes in the year following tube placement. Young age, recurrent acute otitis media being the indication for tube placement, a recent history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and the presence of older siblings were independently associated with the future occurrence of TTO, and can therefore be seen as predictors for TTO. CONCLUSIONS Our survey confirms that otorrhea is a common sequela in children with tympanostomy tubes, which occurrence can be predicted by age, medical history and presence of older siblings.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacteremia in both children and adults. Currently, the diagnosis of pneumococcal bacteremia relies on the isolation and identification of the bacteria from blood cultures. We have developed a sensitive assay for the detection of S. pneumoniae in whole blood by the PCR. A specific primer-probe set (JM201 and JM202 primers with JM204 probe) designed from the penicillin-binding protein 2B gene was demonstrated to reproducibly detect between 10 and 100 fg of input purified S. pneumoniae DNA. This assay system was shown to be inclusive for all strains of S. pneumoniae evaluated, including 15 different serotypes and a battery of penicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains. The specificity of this PCR-based assay was demonstrated by its inability to support amplification from a series of human, bacterial, and yeast genomic DNAs. A general specimen preparation method which should be suitable for the purification of DNA from any pathogens in whole blood was developed. With this protocol it was possible to detect S. pneumoniae-specific DNA from whole blood specimens inoculated with as little as 4 CFU/ml. Copurified human blood DNA, ranging from 0 to 4.5 micrograms per PCR, did not affect the sensitivity of S. pneumoniae detection by PCR. A blinded clinical trial was used to compare the PCR-based assay with standard microbiological blood culture for the detection of S. pneumoniae bacteremia in 36 specimens obtained from pediatric patients seen in the emergency room of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. With culture as the "gold standard," the PCR-based assay had a sensitivity of 80{\%} (4 of 5 culture-positive specimens were PCR positive) and a specificity of 84{\%} (26 of 31 culture-negative specimens were PCR negative). However, three patients whose specimens were PCR positive and culture negative had histories suggestive of bacteremia, including recent positive blood cultures, treatment with antibiotics, cellulitis, and multiple emergency room visits for fever within a 24-h period. These data suggest that PCR-based assays for S. pneumoniae may prove useful to augment current methods of detection for S. pneumoniae bacteremia.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. However, it can also asymptomatically colonize the upper respiratory tract. Because of the need to distinguish between S. pneumoniae that is simply colonizing the upper respiratory tract and S. pneumoniae that is causing pneumonia, accurate diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia is a challenging issue that still needs to be solved. Sputum Gram stains and culture are the first diagnostic step for identifying pneumococcal pneumonia and provide information on antibiotic susceptibility. However, these conventional methods are relatively slow and insensitive and show limited specificity. In the past decade, new diagnostic tools have been developed, particularly antigen (teichoic acid and capsular polysaccharides) and nucleic acid (ply, lytA, and Spn9802) detection assays. Use of the pneumococcal antigen detection methods along with biomarkers (C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) may enhance the specificity of diagnosis for pneumococcal pneumonia. This article provides an overview of current methods of diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia and discusses new and future test methods that may provide the way forward for improving its diagnosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cost-effectiveness studies have been increasingly part of decision processes for incorporating new vaccines into the Brazilian National Immunisation Program. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) in the universal childhood immunisation programme in Brazil. METHODS A decision-tree analytical model based on the ProVac Initiative pneumococcus model was used, following 25 successive cohorts from birth until 5 years of age. Two strategies were compared: (1) status quo and (2) universal childhood immunisation programme with PCV10. Epidemiological and cost estimates for pneumococcal disease were based on National Health Information Systems and literature. A 'top-down' costing approach was employed. Costs are reported in 2004 Brazilian reals. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3{\%}. RESULTS 25 years after implementing the PCV10 immunisation programme, 10 226 deaths, 360 657 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 433 808 hospitalisations and 5 117 109 outpatient visits would be avoided. The cost of the immunisation programme would be R{\$}10 674 478 765, and the expected savings on direct medical costs and family costs would be R{\$}1 036 958 639 and R{\$}209 919 404, respectively. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R{\$}778 145/death avoided and R{\$}22 066/DALY avoided from the society perspective. CONCLUSION The PCV10 universal infant immunisation programme is a cost-effective intervention (1-3 GDP per capita/DALY avoided). Owing to the uncertain burden of disease data, as well as unclear long-term vaccine effects, surveillance systems to monitor the long-term effects of this programme will be essential.},

We investigated the prognostic impact of a pulmonary infiltrate and bacteraemia on the clinical course of hospitalized patients with confirmed pneumococcal LRTI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We studied a population-based multi-centre cohort of 705 adults hospitalized with LRTI and Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRT specimens or blood: 193 without pulmonary infiltrate or bacteraemia, 250 with X-ray confirmed pneumonia, and 262 with bacteraemia. We compared adverse outcomes in the three groups and used multiple regression analyses to adjust for differences in age, sex, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Patients with no infiltrate and no bacteraemia were of similar age but had more comorbidity than the other groups (Charlson index score ≥1: no infiltrate and no bacteraemia 81{\%} vs. infiltrate without bacteraemia 72{\%} vs. bacteraemia 61{\%}), smoked more tobacco, and had more respiratory symptoms. In contrast, patients with a pulmonary infiltrate or bacteraemia had more inflammation (median C-reactive protein: no infiltrate and no bacteraemia 82 mg/L vs. infiltrate without bacteraemia 163 mg/L vs. bacteraemia 316 mg/L) and higher acute disease severity scores. All adverse outcomes increased from patients with no infiltrate and no bacteraemia to those with an infiltrate and to those with bacteraemia: Length of hospital stay (5 vs. 6 vs. 8 days); intensive care admission (7{\%} vs. 20{\%} vs. 23{\%}); pulmonary complications (1{\%} vs. 5{\%} vs. 14{\%}); and 30-day mortality (5{\%} vs. 11{\%} vs. 21{\%}). Compared with patients with no infiltrate and no bacteraemia, the adjusted 30-day mortality rate ratio was 1.9 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.9-4.1) in patients with an infiltrate without bacteraemia and 4.1 (95{\%} CI 2.0-8.5) in bacteraemia patients. Adjustment for acute disease severity and inflammatory markers weakened these associations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization with confirmed pneumococcal LRTI is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality even without positive chest X-ray findings and blood cultures. Still, there is a clinically important outcome gradient from LRTI patients with pneumococcal isolation only to those with detected pulmonary infiltrate or bacteraemia which is partly mediated by higher acute disease severity and inflammation.},

Nasopharyngeal samples were collected at prescheduled 2-4 week intervals from the index children and from their family members. The nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured for pneumococcal growth and pneumococci were identified and serotyped by standard methods. RESULTS: We collected 1459 samples (92{\%} of those planned) from the 99 index children and 2865 samples from other family members. The data showed high point prevalences of pneumococcal carriage among newborns (40-50{\%} from 8 weeks of age on), a rapid pneumococcal acquisition with age (50{\%} of the children had been colonized by pneumococci at least once by the age of 8 weeks) and a wide range of different serogroups/types (SGT). SGT 6 and 19 accounted for 35{\%} of the pneumococci isolated from children {\textless}1-year-old, followed by SGT 15, 23, and 10 for a total of 56{\%}. The SGT distribution in children up to 9-year-old was similar to that among the {\textless}1 year olds, with SGT 6 and 19 predominating. Older children and adults differed from the younger children by not having clearly predominating SGTs. CONCLUSIONS: The features found in our study are typical of pneumococcal carriage in developing countries. We believe that results from longitudinal modeling of carriage based on these extensive data can have wide geographic application.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Interrupted time series (ITS) is a strong quasi-experimental research design, which is increasingly applied to estimate the effects of health services and policy interventions. We describe and illustrate two methods for estimating confidence intervals (CIs) around absolute and relative changes in outcomes calculated from segmented regression parameter estimates. 

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
We used multivariate delta and bootstrapping methods (BMs) to construct CIs around relative changes in level and trend, and around absolute changes in outcome based on segmented linear regression analyses of time series data corrected for autocorrelated errors. 

RESULTS
Using previously published time series data, we estimated CIs around the effect of prescription alerts for interacting medications with warfarin on the rate of prescriptions per 10,000 warfarin users per month. Both the multivariate delta method (MDM) and the BM produced similar results. 

CONCLUSION
BM is preferred for calculating CIs of relative changes in outcomes of time series studies, because it does not require large sample sizes when parameter estimates are obtained correctly from the model. Caution is needed when sample size is small.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contributed to a substantial decrease in the number of ambulatory visits attributable to acute otitis media (AOM) and amoxicillin use for AOM increased after publication of American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines regarding AOM. Our objective was to determine whether similar trends occurred for children with acute sinusitis. METHODS We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1998-2007), which are nationally representative surveys of office and emergency department visits. For children younger than 18 years with diagnosed acute sinusitis (N = 538), we examined time trends in visit rates and antibiotic prescribing. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with narrow-spectrum antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS Between 1998 and 2007, the annual visit rate for acute sinusitis remained stable, ranging from 11 to 14 visits per 1000 children (P = .67). No change occurred in the proportion of visits with receipt of an antibiotic (82{\%}; P = .71); however, the proportion with receipt of amoxicillin increased from 19{\%} to 58{\%} during the study period (P {\textless} .01). Prescriptions for broader-spectrum agents, especially macrolides (18{\%} overall), remained common. CONCLUSIONS Unlike the visit rate for AOM, the visit rate for acute sinusitis among children did not decrease after introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Although prescriptions for amoxicillin increased in accordance with the guidelines, reducing unnecessary prescriptions for macrolides remains an important target for campaigns promoting judicious antibiotic use.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the approaches used in the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEAs) literature to estimate the cost of expanded program on immunization (EPI) activities, other than vaccine purchase, for rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines.

METHODS: A systematic review in PubMed and NHS EED databases of rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines CEAs was done. Selected articles were read and information on how EPI costs were calculated was extracted. EPI costing approaches were classified according to the method or assumption used for estimation.

RESULTS: Seventy-nine studies that evaluated cost effectiveness of rotavirus (n=43) or pneumococcal (n=36) vaccines were identified. In general, there are few details on how EPI costs other than vaccine procurement were estimated. While 30 studies used some measurement of that cost, only one study on pneumococcal vaccine used a primary cost evaluation (bottom-up costing analysis) and one study used a costing tool. Twenty-seven studies (17 on rotavirus and 10 on pneumococcal vaccine) assumed the non-vaccine costs. Five studies made no reference to additional costs. Fourteen studies (9 rotavirus and 5 pneumococcal) did not consider any additional EPI cost beyond vaccine procurement. For rotavirus studies, the median for non-vaccine cost per dose was US{\$}0.74 in developing countries and US{\$}6.39 in developed countries. For pneumococcal vaccines, the median for non-vaccine cost per dose was US{\$}1.27 in developing countries and US{\$}8.71 in developed countries.

CONCLUSIONS: Many pneumococcal (52.8{\%}) and rotavirus (60.4{\%}) cost-effectiveness analyses did not consider additional EPI costs or used poorly supported assumptions. Ignoring EPI costs in addition to those for vaccine procurement in CEA analysis of new vaccines may lead to significant errors in the estimations of ICERs since several factors like personnel, cold chain, or social mobilization can be substantially affected by the introduction of new vaccines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people suffer substantially higher rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) than the general US population. We evaluated antimicrobial prescribing data and their association with non-susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae causing IPD in AI/AN people between 1992 and 2009. METHODS: Antimicrobial use data were gathered from the electronic patient management system and included all prescriptions dispensed to Alaska Native patients aged 5 years and older from outpatient pharmacies at the Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC). Antimicrobial susceptibility data were gathered from pneumococcal isolates causing IPD among Anchorage Service Unit AI/AN residents aged 5 years and older. Data were restricted to serotypes not contained in the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). RESULTS: Over the study period, overall antimicrobial prescribing increased 59{\%} (285/1,000 persons/year in 1992 to 454/1,000 persons per year in 2009, p{\textless}0.001). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prescribing increased (43/1,000 persons/year in 1992 to 108/1,000 persons/year in 2009, p{\textless}0.001) and non-susceptibility to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in AI/AN patients {\textgreater}/=5 years of age increased in non-PCV7 serotypes (0-12{\%}, p{\textless}0.05). Similarly, prescribing rates increased for macrolide antibiotics (46/1,000 persons/year in 1992 to 84/1,000 persons/year in 2009, p{\textless}0.05). We observed no statistically significant change over time in erythromycin non-susceptibility among non-PCV7 serotypes in AI/AN patients aged 5 years or greater (0-7{\%}, p=0.087). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial prescribing patterns of some antibiotics in the AI/AN population corresponded to increased antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates. This study highlights the on-going threat of antimicrobial resistance, the critical importance of judicious prescribing of antibiotics and the potential utility of prescribing data for addressing this issue.},

abstract = {An international group of multidisciplinary experts on middle-ear and paediatric infections met to explore where consensus exists on the management of acute otitis media. After informal discussions among several specialists of paediatric infectious disease, the group was expanded to include a larger spectrum of professionals with complementary expertise in middle-ear disease. Acute otitis media is a very common bacterial infection in children worldwide, leading to excessive antibiotic consumption in children in most countries and to a substantial burden of deafness and suppurative complications in developing countries. The group attempted to move beyond the existing controversies surrounding guidelines on acute otitis media, and to propose to clinicians and public health officials their views on the actions needed to be taken to reduce the disease burden caused by acute otitis media and the microbial antibiotic resistance from the resulting use of antibiotics. Definition of acute otitis media and diagnostic accuracy are crucial steps to identify children who will potentially benefit from treatment with antibiotics and to eliminate unnecessary prescribing. Although the group agreed that antibiotics are distributed indiscriminately, even to children who do not seem to have the disease, no consensus could be reached on whether antibiotics should be given to all appropriately diagnosed children, reflecting the wide range of practices and lack of convincing evidence from observational studies. The major unanimous concern was an urgent need to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics to prevent further increases in antibiotic resistance. Prevention of acute otitis media with existing and future viral and bacterial vaccines seems the most promising approach to affect disease burden and consequences, both in developed and developing countries. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To describe the role patient expectations play in general practitioners (GPs) antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). METHODS Concurrent explanatory mixed methods approach using a cross-sectional survey and semistructured interviews. SETTINGS Primary care GPs in Australia. PARTICIPANTS 584 GPs (response rate of 23.6{\%}) completed the cross-sectional survey. 32 GPs were interviewed individually. OUTCOME MEASURE Prescribing of antibiotics for URTI. RESULTS More than half the GP respondents to the survey in Australia self-reported that they would prescribe antibiotics for an URTI to meet patient expectations. Our qualitative findings suggest that 'patient expectations' may be the main reason given for inappropriate prescribing, but it is an all-encompassing phrase that includes other reasons. These include limited time, poor doctor-patient communication and diagnostic uncertainty. We have identified three role archetypes to explain the behaviour of GPs in reference to antibiotic prescribing for URTIs. The main themes emerging from the qualitative component was that many GPs did not think that antibiotic prescribing in primary care was responsible for the development of antibiotic resistance nor that their individual prescribing would make any difference in light of other bigger issues like hospital prescribing or veterinary use. For them, there were negligible negative consequences from their inappropriate prescribing. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to increase awareness of the scope and magnitude of antibiotic resistance and the role primary care prescribing plays, and of the contribution of individual prescribing decisions to the problem of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although invasive pneumococcal pneumonia remains responsible for a significant number of child hospitalizations, specific data on hospital resource utilization and related costs are limited.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost of hospitalizing children with invasive pneumococcal pneumonia and identify the cost determinants of the disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Economic evaluation based on an observational study of all children {\textless}18 years of age with culture-proved invasive pneumococcal pneumonia admitted to a referral hospital in Barcelona (Spain) during the period January 2001-December 2011. Analysis included demographic, microbiological, epidemiological and clinical variables.

RESULTS: A total of 135 children were included in the study (median age 3.3 years). PCV13 serotypes were detected in 132 (97.8{\%}) cases. Median hospital cost was €4533 (€4078-5435, 95{\%} CI). Median length of stay was 11.0 days (10.6-13.0 days, 95{\%} CI). Variables significantly associated with increased cost in the multivariate analysis were complicated pneumonia (≥2 and 1 complication) versus non-complicated pneumonia (€4919 and €2822 vs. €1399), performance of surgery versus no surgery (€4849 vs. €1435), intensive care versus no intensive care (€6488 vs. €3862) and identification of non-PCV7 serotypes versus PCV7 serotypes (€4656 vs. €1470).

CONCLUSION: Invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in children makes substantial demands on hospital health care and financial resources that could be mitigated with universal PCV13 childhood immunization programmes and early management of complications.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis for which antibiotics are prescribed for children. Previous trials that have evaluated a "wait-and-see prescription" (WASP) for antibiotics, with which parents are asked not to fill the prescription unless the child either is not better or is worse in 48 hours, have excluded children with severe AOM. None of these trials were conducted in an emergency department. OBJECTIVES To determine whether treatment of AOM using a WASP significantly reduces use of antibiotics compared with a "standard prescription" (SP) and to evaluate the effects of this intervention on clinical symptoms and adverse outcomes related to antibiotic use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A randomized controlled trial conducted between July 12, 2004, and July 11, 2005. Children with AOM aged 6 months to 12 years seen in an emergency department were randomly assigned to receive either a WASP or an SP. All patients received ibuprofen and otic analgesic drops for use at home. A research assistant, blinded to group assignment, conducted structured phone interviews 4 to 6, 11 to 14, and 30 to 40 days after enrollment to determine outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Filling of the antibiotic prescription and clinical course. RESULTS Overall, 283 patients were randomized either to the WASP group (n = 138) or the SP group (n = 145). Substantially more parents in the WASP group did not fill the antibiotic prescription (62{\%} vs 13{\%}; P{\textless}.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the frequency of subsequent fever, otalgia, or unscheduled visits for medical care. Within the WASP group, both fever (relative risk [RR], 2.95; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.75 - 4.99; P{\textless}.001) and otalgia (RR, 1.62; 95{\%} CI, 1.26 - 2.03; P{\textless}.001) were associated with filling the prescription. CONCLUSION The WASP approach substantially reduced unnecessary use of antibiotics in children with AOM seen in an emergency department and may be an alternative to routine use of antimicrobials for treatment of such children.

We report data from nationwide surveillance of IPD in children with two reporting sources, pediatric hospitals and microbiological laboratories in Germany. Incidence rates with regard to age groups and pneumococcal serotypes are based on capture recapture estimates combining the two reporting sources. Between July 1, 1997 and June 30, 2003, 2680 cases (an average 447 yearly cases) of IPD were observed in children {\textless}16 years in Germany compared to 223 cases between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008. A significant reduction in overall incidence (4/100,000-3.2/100,000) was attributed to significant reductions in children younger than 2 years (20.0/100,000-11.0/100,000). While the incidence of all serotypes included in the vaccine was reduced in the age group {\textless}2 years, the incidence of non-vaccine serotypes remained stable.

abstract = {Several cell types, in particular epithelial cells, express the receptor for the cytokine IL-22 and upon its recognition produce molecules that are active both locally and systemically. Many different types of lymphocyte secrete IL-22. T(h)17 cells produce IL-22 although the optimal conditions for secretion of IL-17 or IL-22 by T(h)17 cells differ, as do the transcription factors involved. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is required for IL-22 production by T(h)17, T(h)22 and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells. T(h)22 cells produce IL-22 in response to IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), particularly in the skin, whereas $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells produce IL-22 in response to IL-23, particularly in the lung. NK cells produce IL-22 in response to IL-12 and IL-18 or IL-23. Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor$\gamma$t-positive innate lymphoid cells, including lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) and LTi-like cells express IL-22 with IL-23 again enhancing expression. IL-22 is known to be expressed in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and its up-regulation often correlates with disease activity. IL-22 is known to be protective in the gastrointestinal tract in inflammatory bowel disease but may mediate either harmful or helpful inflammatory responses in different models of intestinal infection. Finally, IL-22 may also play an important role in tissue repair.},

Our objective in this study was to obtain a snapshot of pneumococcal carriage frequency, colonizing serotypes, and antibiotic resistance in healthy children in two Italian cities one year after PCV13 was introduced.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 571 children aged 0-5 years from November 2011-April 2012. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Penicillin and/or erythromycin non-susceptible isolates were analyzed by Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among the children examined, 81.2{\%} had received at least one dose of PCV7 or PCV13 and 74.9{\%} had completed the recommended vaccination schedule for their age. Among the latter, 57.3{\%} of children had received PCV7, 27.1{\%} PCV13, and 15.6{\%} a combination of the two vaccines. The overall carriage rate was 32.9{\%}, with children aged 6-35 months the most prone to pneumococcal colonization (6-23 months OR: 3.75; 95{\%} CI: 2.19-6.43 and 24-35 months OR: 3.15, 95{\%}CI: 2.36-4.22). A total of 184 pneumococcal isolates were serotyped and divided into PCV7 (5.4{\%}), PCV13 (18.0{\%}), and non-PCV13 (82.0{\%}) serotypes. Serotypes 6C, 24F, and 19A were the most prevalent (10.3{\%}, 8.6{\%}, and 8.1{\%}, respectively). The proportion of penicillin non-susceptible (MIC {\textgreater}0.6 mg/L) isolates was 30.9{\%}, while 42.3{\%} were erythromycin resistant. Non-PCV13 serotypes accounted for 75.4{\%} and 70.8{\%} of the penicillin and erythromycin non-susceptible isolates, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed low rates of PCV7 and PCV13 serotypes in Italian children, potentially due to the effects of vaccination. As the use of PCV13 continues, its potential impact on vaccine serotypes such as 19A and cross-reactive serotypes such as 6C will be assessed, with this study providing a baseline for further analysis of surveillance isolates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between specific pneumococcal serotypes and mortality from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a nationwide population-based cohort study of IPD in Denmark during 1977-2007, 30-d mortality associated with pneumococcal serotypes was examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis after controlling for potential confounders. A total of 18,858 IPD patients were included. Overall 30-d mortality was 18{\%}, and 3{\%} in children younger than age 5 y. Age, male sex, meningitis, high comorbidity level, alcoholism, and early decade of diagnosis were significantly associated with mortality. Among individuals aged 5 y and older, serotypes 31, 11A, 35F, 17F, 3, 16F, 19F, 15B, and 10A were associated with highly increased mortality as compared with serotype 1 (all: adjusted odds ratio {\textgreater}or=3, p{\textless}0.001). In children younger than 5 y, associations between serotypes and mortality were different than in adults but statistical precision was limited because of low overall childhood-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Specific pneumococcal serotypes strongly and independently affect IPD associated mortality.},

Explain why myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion (M{\&}T) is preferable to antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recurrent AOM for children in child care who are at increased risk of colonization with multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae . 3. Describe the possible complications following M{\&}T and their treatments. M{\&}T is the most commonly performed surgical operation among United States children beyond the newborn period. A systematic national survey found that approximately 512,000 M{\&}T operations were performed in 1996 in United States children younger than 15 years of age; of these, approximately 280,000 were in children younger than 3 years of age. The frequency with which the operation is performed is affected by several circumstances. First, next to the common cold, otitis media (OM), encompassing both AOM and OME, is the most commonly diagnosed and probably the most prevalent illness in United States children. Second, OM often becomes chronic and often recurs. Third, OM usually is accompanied by a variable degree of conductive hearing loss. Fourth, there has been concern that prolonged OME may result in untoward otologic or audiologic sequelae, and that sustained OME-related hearing loss during the first few years after birth, even though limited to that period, might result in later impairments of children's speech, language, or cognitive skills or their psychosocial adjustment. Fifth, conservative measures often fail to prevent chronicity of OME or recurrences of AOM. Finally, M{\&}T reliably brings about prompt resolution of persistent OME and its attendant hearing loss and usually succeeds in completely or largely preventing AOM recurrences for periods ranging from months to years.

Furthermore, we are beginning to comprehend the roles of S. epidermidis in balancing the epithelial microflora and serving as a reservoir of resistance genes.

abstract = {Introduction: Pneumococcal disease is a major public health problem worldwide. From March to September of 2010, 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was introduced in the Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) in all 27 Brazilian states. The aim of the present study is to report national time-trends in incidence of hospital admissions for childhood pneumonia in Brazil before and after two years of introduction of this new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Methods: Analysis of hospitalization data of children aged 0-4 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia from 2002 to 2012 was performed comparing pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination periods (2011-2012). Hospital number of admission due to pneumonia and all non-respiratory diseases were obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian government open-access public health database system. Incidence of pneumonia hospitalization was compared to incidence of all non-respiratory admissions. Results: Admission rates for pneumonia decreased steadily from 2010 to 2012. In children aged less than four years, incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations decreased 12.65{\%} when pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination introduction periods (2011-2012) were compared and adjusted for seasonality and secular-trend (p{\textless}. 0.001). On the other hand, non-respiratory admission rates remained stable comparing both periods (p= 0.39). Conclusion: Childhood pneumonia hospitalization rates were fluctuating prior to 2010 and decreased significantly in the two years after PHiD-CV introduction. Conversely, rate of non-respiratory admissions has shown no decrease. These data are an evidence of the effectiveness and public health impact of this new pneumococcal vaccine. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rates of acquisition and mean duration of nasal carriage of different serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae have been estimated by fitting a stochastic model to longitudinal carriage data in children from Papua New Guinea. Immunogenicity and two indices of relative invasiveness were determined for each serotype. Immunogenic serotypes were less frequently acquired and were carried for shorter periods, but no relationship between immunogenicity and invasiveness was apparent using either index of invasiveness. Frequent invasion was associated with a high acquisition rate and high frequency and prolonged duration of carriage. Carriage studies can provide a broad indication of which serotypes cause invasive disease but not the proportion of disease due to individual serotypes; some serotypes which cause invasive disease (e.g. serotype 46) are not found even in extensive carriage studies. The antibiotic resistance of carriage organisms, however, does approximate the resistance patterns of invasive organisms and thus may be used to monitor changing patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility in the community.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use detailed weekly data on outpatient antibiotic sales for pre-school children in Sweden to test for the significance of trends during 1992-2002. We also report on the special features found in weekly antibiotic data, and how the interrupted time series (ITS) design can adjust for this. METHODS: Weekly data on the total number of dispensed outpatient antibiotic prescriptions to pre-school children were studied, as well as the individual subgroups commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections in children: narrow-spectrum penicillins, broad-spectrum penicillins and macrolides. In parallel, monthly data of paracetamol sales of paediatric dosages were analysed to reflect trends in symptomatic treatment. An ITS model controlling for seasonality and autocorrelation was used to examine the datasets for significant level and trend shifts. RESULTS: A significant increase in mean and change in level could be found in the total antibiotic data in 1997, also reflected in broad-spectrum penicillin data where a similar trend break occurred in 1996. For macrolides, a trend break with a decrease in mean was noted in 1996, but no trend breaks were found in narrow-spectrum penicillin data. In contrast to the general decreasing trends in antibiotic sales, the yearly over-the-counter sales of paracetamol in paediatric preparations increased during the same period, with no identified trend breaks. CONCLUSIONS: The overall decrease in antibiotic sales and increase in paediatric paracetamol sales might suggest that symptomatic treatment in the home has increased, as antibiotics are less commonly prescribed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyse the evolution of antibiotic non-susceptibility in Spanish invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae after licensure of respiratory-quinolones for adults and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) for immunization of children. METHODS: All invasive pneumococci received in the Reference Laboratory (January 2000-August 2007; n = 12 957 isolates) were serotyped, and susceptibility to penicillin/erythromycin/levofloxacin was determined. Antibiotic consumption and PCV-7 doses/year were provided by IMS and the manufacturer, respectively. RESULTS: In 2000-07, PCV-7 distribution (doses/1000 inhabitants {\textless}/=59 months age/year) increased from 0.0 to 411.90, and antibiotic consumption (DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) was maintained for beta-lactams ( approximately 16), decreased for macrolides (from 4.4 to 2.7) and increased for respiratory fluoroquinolones (from 0.3 to 2.7). The increase in PCV-7 distribution correlated with a decrease in PCV-7 serotypes prevalence among invasive isolates in children (r = -0.976; P {\textless} 0.001) and adults (r = -0.905; P = 0.002). This decrease in PCV-7 serotypes correlated with a decrease in penicillin non-susceptibility in children (r = 0.929; P {\textless} 0.001) and adults (r = 0.905; P = 0.002) and with erythromycin non-susceptibility in children (r = 0.833; P = 0.010). Penicillin/erythromycin non-susceptibility in 2000 was significantly higher in paediatric versus adult isolates (penicillin: 51.4{\%} versus 29.2{\%}; erythromycin: 39.5{\%} versus 20.4{\%}), but similar in 2006-07 (20{\%} to 24{\%}). The increase in respiratory quinolones consumption correlated with the increase in levofloxacin non-susceptibility in adults (r = 0.926; P = 0.008) but not in children, with different non-susceptibility rates in 2007 (1.6{\%} versus 0.0{\%}; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: This ecological analysis suggests that PCV-7 vaccination in children had a herd effect in adults, but consumption of respiratory quinolones in adults had no effect on pneumococcal susceptibility to levofloxacin in children. Penicillin/erythromycin non-susceptibility decreased along the studied period among paediatric invasive S. pneumoniae isolates to a level similar to that seen in adults.},

abstract = {Introduction: Bacterial meningitis is a serious disease with a mortality rate of 15-20{\%} in adults. We conducted a population-based study of bacterial meningitis in adults ({\textgreater} 16 y) in Iceland, 1995-2010. Methods: Cases were identified based on positive bacterial cultures from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or the ICD codes for bacterial meningitis. Medical charts were reviewed and outcomes were assessed using the national population registry. The study period was divided into 2 equal parts, 1995-2002 and 2003-2010, before and after implementation of routine childhood vaccination against serogroup C meningococci, respectively. Results: In total, 111 episodes occurred in 110 individuals. The most common causative organisms were Neisseria meningitidis (41{\%}) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (30{\%}). Only 30{\%} of the patients presented with the classical symptom triad of fever, neck stiffness, and an altered mental status. The overall incidence was 3.2/100,000 inhabitants/y, and dropped significantly between the first and second halves of the study (p = 0.03). This drop was due to a reduced incidence of N. meningitidis meningitis: 34 and 12 cases in the first and second periods, respectively (p = 0.006). The incidence of meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae remained unchanged. The case fatality rates were 18{\%} and 13{\%} in the first and second halves of the study, respectively (difference not significant). Conclusions: The incidence of bacterial meningitis has decreased since the implementation of meningococcal C vaccination in 2002. However, the case fatality rate has remained unchanged. 2014 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The agreement between self-reported and proxy measures of health status in ill children is not well established. This study aimed to quantify the variation in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) derived from young patients and their carers using different instruments. METHODS A hospital-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between August 2010 and March 2011. Children with meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, acute otitis media, hearing loss, chronic lung disease, epilepsy, mild mental retardation, severe mental retardation, and mental retardation combined with epilepsy, aged between five to 14 years in seven tertiary hospitals were selected for participation in this study. The Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), and Mark 3 (HUI3), and the EuroQoL Descriptive System (EQ-5D) and Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) were applied to both paediatric patients (self-assessment) and caregivers (proxy-assessment). RESULTS The EQ-5D scores were lowest for acute conditions such as meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia, whereas the HUI3 scores were lowest for most chronic conditions such as hearing loss and severe mental retardation. Comparing patient and proxy scores (n = 74), the EQ-5D exhibited high correlation (r = 0.77) while in the HUI2 and HUI3 patient and caregiver scores were moderately correlated (r = 0.58 and 0.67 respectively). The mean difference between self and proxy-assessment using the HUI2, HUI3, EQ-5D and EQ-VAS scores were 0.03, 0.05, -0.03 and -0.02, respectively. In hearing-impaired and chronic lung patients the self-rated HRQOL differed significantly from their caregivers. CONCLUSIONS The use of caregivers as proxies for measuring HRQOL in young patients affected by pneumococcal infection and its sequelae should be employed with caution. Given the high correlation between instruments, each of the HRQOL instruments appears acceptable apart from the EQ-VAS which exhibited low correlation with the others.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children. The heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) is offering a promising strategy against pneumococcal disease in children younger than 2 years. In this prospective epidemiological study in Germany, children between 2 and 6 months of age received in a 3:1 ratio a routine childhood vaccine combination with or without PCV7 according to a four-dose schedule. Five thousand nine hundred and eighty-four children were evaluable 1 year after the booster dose. Due to German guidelines children with underlying medical conditions were preferentially included into the PCV7 group and hence 66{\%} of the children in the PCV7 group had at least one medical risk factor and 40{\%} were preterm born compared to 18{\%} and 6{\%} in the control group. Overall PCV7 reduced respiratory tract infections by 10.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.9-17.3{\%}) and clinically diagnosed pneumonia by 6.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: -15.9 to 23.7{\%}) in this unbalanced situation. In a propensity score matched pair analysis controlling for risk factors, effectiveness of PCV7 against pneumonia was 24.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.9-43.1{\%}). In children with at least one medical risk factor vaccine effectiveness against pneumonia was 38.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 10.7-55.9{\%}) compared to 10.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: -20.2 to 33.9{\%}) without a risk factor. In preterm and term born children, PCV7 was well tolerated when simultaneously administered with widely used hexavalent routine vaccine combinations. The results demonstrate that PCV7 is safe and effective against RTI in preterm children and in children with comorbidities stressing the benefit of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in these children at high risk for pneumococcal disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To measure trends in antibiotic prescribing in UK primary care in relation to nationally recommended best practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS A descriptive study linking individual patient data on diagnosis and prescription in a large primary care database, covering 537 UK general practices during 1995-2011. RESULTS The proportion of cough/cold episodes for which antibiotics were prescribed decreased from 47{\%} in 1995 to 36{\%} in 1999, before increasing to 51{\%} in 2011. There was marked variation by primary care practice in 2011 [10th-90th percentile range (TNPR) 32{\%}-65{\%}]. Antibiotic prescribing for sore throats fell from 77{\%} in 1995 to 62{\%} in 1999 and then stayed broadly stable (TNPR 45{\%}-78{\%}). Where antibiotics were prescribed for sore throat, recommended antibiotics were used in 69{\%} of cases in 2011 (64{\%} in 1995). The use of recommended short-course trimethoprim for urinary tract infection (UTI) in women aged 16-74 years increased from 8{\%} in 1995 to 50{\%} in 2011; however, a quarter of practices prescribed short courses in ≤16{\%} of episodes in 2011. For otitis media, 85{\%} of prescriptions were for recommended antibiotics in 2011, increasing from 77{\%} in 1995. All these changes in annual prescribing were highly statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The implementation of national guidelines in UK primary care has had mixed success, with prescribing for coughs/colds, both in total and as a proportion of consultations, now being greater than before recommendations were made to reduce it. Extensive variation by practice suggests that there is significant scope to improve prescribing, particularly for coughs/colds and for UTIs.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for infants has recently been found effective against meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and otitis media. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the projected health and economic impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination of healthy US infants and young children. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from the Northern California Kaiser Permanente randomized trial and other published and unpublished sources. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A hypothetical US birth cohort of 3.8 million infants. INTERVENTIONS: Hypothetical comparisons of routine vaccination of healthy infants, requiring 4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months), and catch-up vaccination of children aged 2 to 4.9 years requiring 1 dose, with children receiving no intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per life-year saved and cost per episode of meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and otitis media prevented. RESULTS: Vaccination of healthy infants would prevent more than 12000 cases of meningitis and bacteremia, 53000 cases of pneumonia, 1 million episodes of otitis media, and 116 deaths due to pneumococcal infection. Before accounting for vaccine costs, the vaccination program would save {\$}342 million in medical and {\$}415 million in work-loss and other costs from averted pneumococcal disease. Vaccination of healthy infants would result in net savings for society if the vaccine cost less than {\$}46 per dose, and net savings for the health care payer if the vaccine cost less than {\$}18 per dose. At the manufacturer's list price of {\$}58 per dose, infant vaccination would cost society {\$}80000 per life-year saved or {\$}160 per otitis media episode prevented (other estimated costs would be {\$}3200 per pneumonia case prevented, {\$}15000 for bacteremia, and {\$}280000 for meningitis). The cost-effectiveness of an additional program to administer 1 dose of vaccine to children aged 2 to 4.9 years would vary depending on the children's ages, relative risks of pneumococcal disease, and vaccine cost. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination of healthy US infants has the potential to be cost-effective. To achieve cost savings, its cost would need to be lower than the manufacturer's list price. In addition to tangible costs, the vaccine should be appraised based on the less tangible value of preventing mortality and morbidity from pneumococcal disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Widespread antimicrobial use is a risk factor for development of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) may not always be necessary. Little is known about the influence of parental expectations on physicians' decision-making in relation to treatment of AOM. Evidence is insufficient as to whether tympanostomy tube placement reduces antibiotic consumption. METHODS We randomly selected 1,030 children 1 to 6 years old living in 4 geographic areas in Iceland to be invited to participate in the study. Information about sociodemographic factors, antimicrobial prescriptions and their indications during the preceding 12 months, tympanostomy tube placements and parental views on antimicrobial use and bacterial resistance were obtained from a questionnaire completed by the parents and medical records. RESULTS The incidence of AOM episodes resulting in antimicrobial prescription for 804 children recruited into the study was 0.7 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.8) per child per year, highest among children age 1 year, i.e. 1.8 prescriptions (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.2). The cumulative incidence of tympanostomy tube placements was approximately 30{\%}. Antimicrobial use during the preceding 8 weeks for children with and without tubes did not differ (P = 0.36). Fifteen percent of children with tubes had received antimicrobials during the preceding 8 weeks at last once for AOM compared with 14{\%} of those without tubes (P = 0.97). Parents in the area where antimicrobial consumption was lowest were less likely to accept antimicrobial treatment than parents in the other areas (P = 0.005). Parents of children who had previously received antimicrobials for AOM were more likely to accept antimicrobials (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Parental expectations to antimicrobial treatment and awareness about resistance development appear to influence treatment strategies for AOM. The high rate of tympanostomy tube placement in preschool children does not result in reduced antimicrobial consumption.},

abstract = {Objective: Documentation of the effect of tympanostomy tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) is limited. A recently published Cochrane review on the effect of tympanostomy tubes in children with RAOM was based on only two studies. Could the documentation be increased by including other randomized studies? Methods: A MEDLINE and EMBASE search for randomized controlled trials was performed and 143 eligible papers were found. Only five studies could be included. All five were randomized studies with a total of 519 children, four randomized by children and one by ears. All five studies had different designs and control groups, making a proper meta-analysis impossible. Three studies had an antibiotic treated group, two studies a placebo group, and two studies a no treatment group as comparison group. Outcome measures were rates of AOM or fraction free of AOM in six or 12 months. Results: Between two and five children have to be treated with tympanostomy tubes to prevent one child from attacks of acute otitis media (AOM) in six months. Tube treatment could reduce AOM with about one attack in six months after operation. Six months treatment with antibiotics was not different from treatment with tubes. No study reported quality of life for child and family or parental absence from day care or work. Conclusion: Insertion of tympanostomy tubes or long-term treatment with antibiotics seems to prevent one attack of AOM or keep one child out of three free from AOM in six months. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important human pathogens. The rapid emergence and global spread of resistance against the most important antibiotics is therefore a serious public health concern. Resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics is due to alteration of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes responsible for cell wall synthesis. This alteration implies reduced affinity for penicillin and also for other $\beta$-lactam drugs, but to a different extent. Under the influence of antibiotic selective pressure, increase in resistance prevalence is due to (1) horizontal transfer of low-affinity PBP gene segments from closely related $\alpha$-haemolytic streptococci by natural transformation, (2) spread of antibiotic-resistant clones and (3) further remodelling of PBP genes by mutations and further gene exchange. Although the risk factors associated with carriage and infection by resistant strains are well known, the effect of community-wide interventions is not. Prudent use of antibiotics, vaccination by improved conjugate vaccines and infection control measures are likely to be important in preserving the efficacy of avaliable antimicrobial agents.},

abstract = {To determine whether nasopharyngeal carriage isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae are of the same genetic background as isolates that caused invasive disease in one community, IS1167 and boxA genotypes were obtained for 182 pneumococcal isolates from children living in central Tennessee. The isolates represented 70 combined IS1167-boxA genotypes. The genotypic diversity of the invasive isolates was significantly less than that of the total population (P=.003). Most of the carriage isolates belonged to genotypes unique to carriage, whereas most of the invasive isolates belonged to genotypes common to carriage and disease (P=.02). Monte Carlo simulations showed a greater number of genotypes unique to carriage than can be explained by chance (P{\textless}.05 in all cases). Two genotypes were identified by multilocus sequence typing as members of globally disseminated clones, and one such genotype that was strictly carriage in this sample caused disease in other studies. Thus, clones can have different propensities for carriage and invasion.},

abstract = {Objective: The burden of disease due to otitis media (OM) in Asia Pacific countries was reviewed to increase awareness and raise understanding within the region. Methods: Published literature and unpublished studies were reviewed. Results: In school-age children, OM prevalence varied between 3.25{\%} (Thailand) and 12.23{\%} (Philippines) being highest (42{\%}) in Aboriginal Australian children. OME prevalence at school age varied between 1.14{\%} (Thailand) and 13.8{\%} (Malaysia). Higher prevalence was reported in children with hearing impairment, HIV, pneumonia and rhinitis. CSOM prevalence was 5.4{\%} in Indonesia (all ages), 15{\%} in Aboriginal Australian children and 2-4{\%} in Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam (WHO estimate). OM prevalence/incidence and service utilisation were highest in children 2-5 years of age. The disease burden was substantially higher in Pacific Island children living in New Zealand (25.4{\%} with OME), and was highest in indigenous Australians ({\textgreater}90{\%} with any OM). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae dominated as primary causes of AOM in all studies. Few studies examined pneumococcal serotype distribution. Health-related cost estimates for OM, when available, were substantial. In developing countries, significant investment is needed to provide facilities for detection and treatment of ear disease in children, if long term hearing deficits and other sequelae are to be prevented. Conclusion: The available evidence suggests an important burden of disease and economic cost associated with OM in most Asia Pacific countries and a potential benefit of prevention through vaccination. Large, prospective community-based studies are needed to better define the prevalence of ear disease in children, and to predict and track pneumococcal conjugate vaccine impacts. AOM prevention through vaccination may also provide a means of reducing antibiotic use and controlling antibiotic-resistant disease in children. This review highlights the need for additional research, and provides a basis on which to build and develop regional guidelines for OM management. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allow for the most precise assessment of vaccine efficacy against AOM, observational studies provide answers to questions regarding the public health value of these vaccines in real-life settings. We discuss the challenges that arise when measuring PCV impact on AOM in observational studies: the local variability of viral and bacterial etiology, differences in case ascertainment, care-seeking behavior, standards of care and diagnosis of AOM (e.g. use of incisions), as well as declining baseline AOM incidence that can already be in place before PCV introduction, and how these factors can impact the results and their interpretation.},

Easy and quick to use, it has high test-retest repeatability and is sensitive to change after ventilation tube insertion. Objectives To explore aspects of the validity of OM6 in a United Kingdom population and to specifically address the instrument's ability to discriminate between children with different burdens of disease. Design The parents of 179 consecutive newly referred children with otitis media with effusion or recurrent acute otitis media completed the OM6 on their first visit to the hospital. The parents of 72 children with sore throats completed the OM6 for comparison. Scores were compared with markers of disease severity, demographic variables, and generic quality-of-life measures. Results Poorer scores were found in those with ear complaints than in those with sore throats. The OM6 scores were not associated with age, sex, socioeconomic class, or respondent (mother vs father). The OM6 scores did not correlate with frequency of otalgia, frequency of otorrhea, or time off school in the recurrent acute otitis media group. In the otitis media with effusion group, poorer scores were associated with bilateral B or C2 tympanometric findings but not with a better ear threshold of more than 20 dB. Correlation with a global 10-cm visual analog scale for quality of life and with the Health Utilities Index Mark III was good. Conclusions The OM6 scores correlate well with global quality-of-life measures and are free from many potential biases. However, OM6 does not adequately reflect disease severity, which may limit its usefulness as a discriminative measure.},

S pneumoniae is the commonest cause of community acquired pneumonia, accounting for up to 70{\%} of cases in hospital.2 3 Pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with bacteraemia more frequently than other bacterial pneumonias4 and mortality from bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia during the first few days of hospitalisation has changed little since the pre-antibiotic era.5 6 There is also evidence, from the UK and other countries, that the number of cases of pneumococcal bacteraemia is rising.7 8 In the third world five million children under the age of five die each year from acute lower respiratory tract infections in which S pneumoniae is probably the primary agent,9 and patients with HIV infection and AIDS also have a high risk of pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteraemia.10 Furthermore, the worldwide increase in penicillin resistance among pneumococci11-15 and the limited use of the pneumococcal vaccine16 suggest that morbidity and mortality from pneumococcal disease may increase. In recent years there has been an increased understanding of the interactions between the pneumococcus and the host, both in terms of how the virulence factors of the organism contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumonia and how the host's response to infection can be harmful as well as protective. The role of cytokines in pneumococcal pneumonia, the detailed behaviour of neutrophils in the disease, and the mechanisms by which the pneumococcus attaches to the host both during nasopharyngeal colonisation and during invasive disease have all been the subject of recent investigation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Otitis media in young children is associated with major resource use including antimicrobial consumption and tympanostomy tube placements (TTPs). We evaluated the impact of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) introduction into the Finnish National Vaccination Programme (NVP) against these outcomes in vaccine-eligible children. METHODS PCV10-NVP began September 2010 with a 2 + 1 schedule; uptake in 2012 was estimated at 92{\%}. The relative and absolute reduction in the NVP-eligible target cohort was compared with a season and age-matched (3-54 months) cohort before NVP introduction. Outpatient antimicrobial purchase data were collected from the Social Insurance Institution register. Data on purchases of antimicrobials recommended for treatment of acute otitis media by the Finnish Current Care Guidelines (amoxicillin with/without enzyme inhibitor, cefuroxime, cefaclor, clarithromycin, azithromycin) were collected, but full data on penicillin and sulfadiazine/trimethoprim were not available. Data on all TTP procedures were obtained from national hospital discharge register and Social Insurance Institution benefits register. Generalized Cox regression was used in the analysis. RESULTS The incidence rates of antimicrobial purchases in the reference and target cohorts were 1.09 and 0.89 per person-year, respectively. The relative rate reduction was 17.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 17.0-18.1) and the absolute rate reduction 0.20 per person-year. The rates of TTP in the reference and target cohorts were 5.41/100 and 4.56/100 person-years, respectively. The relative rate reduction was 14.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 13.1-16.5) and the absolute rate reduction 0.86/100 person-years. CONCLUSIONS Use of antimicrobials and TTPs reduced after PCV10 was introduced into a routine vaccination program. This suggests considerable savings in health care resource use.},

Methods: All S. pneumoniae isolates from middle ear fluid from children with AOM during 1999-2008 were included. Prospectively collected demographic data on S. pneumoniae serotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns were analyzed. Results: A total of 14,911 tympanocenteses yielded 5281(35{\%}) S. pneumoniae. Proportion of S. pneumoniae-AOM did not vary significantly (overall 35{\%}; 33{\%} in 2007; 38{\%} in 2002 and 2003). The most frequent serotypes were 19F, 14, 23F and 19A; in both Jewish and Bedouin children; serotypes 6A and 19A contributed 6{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively, of all S. pneumoniae isolates.

@article{Winslow1920,
abstract = {In 1758, Linn{\ae}us knew seven bats, all or which he placed in Vespertilio, the fourth and last genus of the order Primates. The work of the next fifty years, as recorded by Tiedemann in 1808, though it had resulted in the recognition of the order Chiroptera, had not increased the species beyond 14, while the number of genera, even with the addition of the flying lemur, was still only seven. The first subdivision of the order into families appears to be due to Goldfuss, who, in 1820, arranged the genera in four groups, one of which still comprised the flying lemur. To each group he definitely applied the name "Familie." The real foundation for the current classification was, however, not laid by Goldfuss, but by Gray, who published the first of his many papers on bats in 1821. Gray excluded the flying lemur, recognized the two main subdivisions of the order, and applied to the names of families the system of nomenclature now in use. According to this scheme there were two suborders, the Fructivor{\ae} and Insectivor{\ae}, the former containing the families Pteropid{\ae} and Cephalotid{\ae}, the latter the Noctilionid{\ae} and Vespcrtilionid{\ae}. Though Gray's system was not followed very closely during the succeeding fifty years, it was finally given definite form by Gill in 1872 and Dobson in 1875, and since then has been almost universally adopted. The new classification now presented is, in fact, little more than an amplification of that founded by Gray. The increase in our knowledge of the Chiroptera since 1821 has been, however, very great. As we have seen, Linn{\ae}us recognized only one genus of bats; Gray placed the number comprised in his four families at about 14. In 1865 Peters divided the group into 10 families and subfamilies, containing, in all, 59 genera. When Dobson published his Catalogue of the Chiroptera in the British Museum, in 1878, he described 401 species, 80 genera, and 14 families and subfamilies. As might have been anticipated, this work, the only complete special monograph of the order, was such a stimulus to the study of bats that since it appeared these animals have received more attention than ever before. In 1904 Trouessart recorded no less than 851 species, 122 genera, and 18 families and subfamilies. It appears, however, that even these numbers are much too small. Detailed study of the skeleton, particularly of the wing and shoulder girdle and of the structure of the tooth cusps, leads me to the conclusion that among the known species at least 173 genera and 36 families and subfamilies should be recoguized. With regard to the species, recent work shows that an enormous increase is to be expected as the characters on which distinctions are based come to be better understood. It seems highly probable that the total number of recognized bats will eventually exceed 2,000 named forms},

abstract = {Introduction: In recent years, vaccine preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis have been re-emerging in Western countries, maybe because of decreasing participation in childhood vaccination programs in some countries. There is clear evidence for vaccine efficacy and the risk of adverse effects is low. This needs to be communicated to the general public. The aim of the study was to evaluate the public opinion on childhood vaccinations in Iceland. Materials and methods: An internet based study was used to evaluate the opinion on childhood immunisations in Iceland. The cohort was divided in three groups: (a) general public (b) employees of the University Hospital Iceland and (c) employees (teachers and staff) of the University of Iceland. The cohorts could be stratified according to age, gender, education, household income, parenthood and residency. Results: Responses were received from 5584 individuals (53{\%} response rate). When asked about childhood vaccinations in the first and second year of life, approximately 95{\%} of participants were "positive" or "very positive", approximately 1{\%} were "negative" or "very negative". When participants were asked whether they would have their child immunized according to the Icelandic childhood vaccination schedule, 96{\%} were "positive" or "very positive", 1.2{\%} were "negative" or "very negative". Similarly, 92{\%} trust Icelandic Health authorities to decide on childhood vaccination schedule, 2.3{\%} did not. In total, 9.3{\%} "rather" or "strongly" agreed to the statement "I fear that vaccinations can cause severe adverse effects", 17.5{\%} were undecided and 66.9{\%} "disagreed" or "strongly disagreed". Individuals with higher education were more likely to disagree with this statement (OR = 1.45, CI95 = 1.29-1.64, p{\textless} 0.001) as did males (OR = 1.22, CI95 = 1.087-1.379, p= 0.001). Conclusion: This study shows a very positive attitude towards vaccinations raising expectations for an ongoing success in preventing preventable communicable diseases in childhood in Iceland.},

The prevalence of serotypes 6E and 6B, but not that of serotypes 6A and 6C, declined after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Serotype 6E isolates showed the highest resistance rate. Most serotype 6E isolates were ST90.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the risk of otitis media with effusion and to search for subgroups in which the vaccine had a higher or lower effect. METHODS: Analyses were performed on data from the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial, a randomised controlled double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against acute otitis media. Data on the vaccination effect against otitis media with effusion were obtained by means of symptom interview and pneumatic otoscopy during pre-scheduled follow-up visits at the age of 7 and 24 months. Two endpoint definitions were considered: otitis media/tube (otitis media or tympanostomy tube in situ (OM/T)) as the primary endpoint and otitis media with effusion as the secondary endpoint. No evidence was found of an age-dependent association with vaccination effect. Therefore, the final marginal logistic regression analyses were performed on the combined data from the two follow-up visits. RESULTS: The risk of otitis media tended to be lower in the pneumococcal vaccine group. The odds ratio for otitis media/tube was 0.94 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.77-1.14) and the odds ratio for otitis media with effusion was 0.90 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.69-1.19). Presence of older siblings increased the risk of otitis media/tube and otitis media with effusion at 7 months of age. In addition, it appeared that children without older siblings and attending day-care at 24 months of age tended to benefit more from the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In this subgroup, the odds ratio for otitis media/tube was 0.81 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.55-1.20) and for otitis media with effusion the odds ratio was 0.43 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.22-0.86). CONCLUSION: The effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on the risk of otitis media with effusion was concordant with the efficacy seen against acute otitis media, although not distinguishable from no effect in the overall analysis. In children without older siblings, vaccination appeared to reduce the point prevalence of otitis media with effusion; this effect was not apparent in children with older siblings.},

abstract = {Building on an idea in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), this article investi- gates the application of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the ef- fects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that following Proposition 99 tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic con- trol region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this ar- ticle, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians) Aim: The aim of this study was to describe antibiotic exposure in Australian infants during the first year of life, focusing on antibiotic class, indication, risk factors associated with exposure and comparison with international counterparts. Methods: The Barwon Infant Study is a birth cohort study (n = 1074) with an unselected antenatal sampling frame from a large regional centre in Victoria, Australia. Longitudinal data on infection and medication were collected at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months by parental questionnaire and from general practitioner and hospital records. Predictors of questionnaire non-completion were identified. A total of 660 infants with complete serial data were comprehensively examined. Antibiotic exposure was calculated as (i) antibiotic prescriptions and (ii) antibiotic days-exposed per person-year. Results: Mean antibiotic prescription rate was 0.92 prescriptions (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.83–1.02) per person-year, with the highest rates in those aged {\textless} 1 month (1.50 (95{\%} CI, 1.09–1.91) per person-year). A total of 50.0{\%} of infants were exposed to at least one antibiotic in their first year of life. Increasing number of siblings was associated with increased antibiotic exposure. Penicillin with extended spectrum (365 of 661 antibiotic prescriptions, 52.6{\%}) and cephalosporins (12.0{\%}) were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. One fifth of antibiotics were prescribed for respiratory tract infections and bronchiolitis. Conclusion: Australian infants in this large population-based study are exposed to considerably more antibiotics than the majority of their international counterparts. Interventions aimed at addressing avoidable prescribing by medical practitioners and modifiable risk factors associated with antibiotic exposure may reduce antibiotic use.},

abstract = {Resistance to antibiotics is a major public health problem and antibiotic use is being increasingly recognized as the main selective pressure driving this resistance. Yearly and quarterly data on outpatient antibiotic use were collected by the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) project for the period 1997-2009 from 33 and 27 European countries, respectively, and expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day. Since repeated measures were taken for the countries, correlation has to be taken into account when analysing the data. This paper illustrates the application of mixed-effects models to the study of country-specific outpatient antibiotic use in Europe. Mixed models are useful in a wide variety of disciplines in the biomedical, physical and social sciences. In this application for outpatient antibiotic use, the linear mixed model is extended to a non-linear mixed model, allowing analysis of seasonal variation on top of a global trend, with country-specific effects for global mean use and amplitude, and trends over time in use and in amplitude.},

In addition 119 malnourished children without pneumonia, 119 well-nourished children with pneumonia and 52 well-nourished children without pneumonia were studied as controls. Percutaneous lung aspiration was performed on 35 malnourished and 59 well-nourished children with pneumonia. Bacteria were isolated from the blood, lung or pleural fluid of 28 (18{\%}) malnourished children with pneumonia, 42 (35{\%}) well-nourished children with pneumonia and from the blood of 5 (4{\%}) malnourished children without pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, which were the two organisms isolated most frequently in both groups of children with pneumonia, were found in 17 (11{\%}) malnourished and 39 (33{\%}) well-nourished children with pneumonia. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in 5 malnourished children with pneumonia. A potentially pathogenic virus was identified in 35{\%} of malnourished children with pneumonia and 40{\%} of well-nourished children with pneumonia, and from 25{\%} of children without pneumonia. The viruses identified most frequently were adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) During November 1990-October 1992 in Banjul, Gambia, providers at a hospital enrolled 159 children with pneumonia and 119 children without pneumonia, 119 well-nourished children with pneumonia, and 52 well-nourished children without pneumonia into a study examining the bacteriologic and virologic etiology of pneumonia. Pneumonia was more common among children with marasmic kwashiorkor (12{\%} of all malnourished children) than among other malnourished children (53{\%} vs. 33{\%}; p 0.05). Most malnourished children (49{\%}) were undernourished. 11{\%} of all malnourished children had kwashiorkor. Laboratory personnel isolated bacteria from 28 (18{\%}) malnourished children with pneumonia, 42 (35{\%}) well-nourished children with pneumonia, and 5 (4{\%}) malnourished children without pneumonia. Among all pneumonia cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the most prevalent bacteria, especially among the well-nourished children (33{\%} vs. 11{\%}; p 0.001). They were not present in malnourished children without pneumonia. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 5 malnourished children with pneumonia. Pathogenic viruses were isolated more often from malnourished children with pneumonia and from well-nourished children with pneumonia than from children without pneumonia (35{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively, vs. 25{\%}; p 0.01). Most common pathogenic viruses were adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV was more common in well-nourished children with pneumonia than malnourished children with pneumonia (13{\%} vs. 6{\%}; p 0.05). Herpes simplex virus was more common in malnourished children with pneumonia than well-nourished children (6{\%} vs. 2{\%}). 25 children had both bacterial and viral pathogens. Only 4 children (all with pneumonia) had the measles virus. These findings suggest that S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are probably the bacterial causes of pneumonia in both well-nourished and malnourished children in areas with rare cases of measles and kwashiorkor. In these areas, M. tuberculosis may be also a cause of pneumonia in malnourished children, especially if edema is present.},

abstract = {Background Australian Indigenous children are the only population worldwide to receive the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) at 18 months of age. We evaluated this program's effectiveness in reducing the risk of hospitalization for acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in Northern Territory (NT) Indigenous children aged 5–23 months.Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving all NT Indigenous children born from 1 April 2000 through 31 October 2004. Person-time at-risk after 0, 1, 2, and 3 doses of 7vPCV and after 0 and 1 dose of 23vPPV and the number of ALRI following each dose were used to calculate dose-specific rates of ALRI for children 5–23 months of age. Rates were compared using Cox proportional hazards models, with the number of doses of each vaccine serving as time-dependent covariates.Results There were 5482 children and 8315 child-years at risk, with 2174 episodes of ALRI requiring hospitalization (overall incidence, 261 episodes per 1000 child-years at risk). Elevated risk of ALRI requiring hospitalization was observed after each dose of the 7vPCV vaccine, compared with that for children who received no doses, and an even greater elevation in risk was observed after each dose of the 23vPPV (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] vs no dose, 1.39; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.71; P = .002). Risk was highest among children vaccinated with the 23vPPV who had received !3 doses of the 7vPCV (adjusted HR, 1.81; 95{\%} CI, 1.32–2.48).Conclusions Our results suggest an increased risk of ALRI requiring hospitalization after pneumococcal vaccination, particularly after receipt of the 23vPPV booster. The use of the 23vPPV booster should be reevaluated. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Penicillin resistance among pneumococci has increased in the past 15 years. The implementation of widespread vaccination with the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and the reduction of inappropriate antibiotic use could help reduce antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Between September 2001 and June 2004, 89 pediatricians distributed throughout France took part in this prospective study. We obtained 1906 nasopharyngeal swabs for culture from children aged 6 to 24 months with acute otitis media (AOM). At the same time as PCV7 was introduced into the routine immunization schedule, a plan to promote judicious antibiotic use was established. We recorded the frequency of antibiotic use, as well as the dates of immunization with PCV7. RESULTS: The proportion of PCV7-vaccinated children ({\textgreater} or =1 dose) increased from 8.2{\%} (year 1) to 61.4{\%} (year 3). The proportion of children who received antibiotics within 3 months before enrollment decreased from 51.8{\%} in year 1 to 40.9{\%} in year 3 (P {\textless} 0.001). Overall pneumococcal carriage and carriage of PCV7 serotypes decreased during the 3-year period by 16{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001) and 35{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Rates of highly penicillin resistant strains (PRP) decreased yearly: 15.4{\%}, 10.6{\%}, 6.7{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Risks for PRP carriage were 4.2{\%} for immunized children who had not received antibiotics, 8.6{\%} for those vaccinated who also had received antibiotics, 10.3{\%} for unimmunized children who had not received antibiotics, and 16.2{\%} for unimmunized children who had received antibiotics (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Implementation of PCV7, combined with a reduction in antibiotic use, in a country with a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci appears to have a strong impact on the carriage of penicillin nonsusceptible pneumococci in children with AOM.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae is a recently described streptococcus that is phenotypically and genetically distinct from Streptococcus pneumoniae and other viridans streptococci. Key characteristics of S. pseudopneumoniae are the absence of a pneumococcal capsule, insolubility in bile, resistance or indeterminate susceptibility to optochin when incubated in 5{\%} CO2 but susceptibility to optochin when incubated in ambient air, and a positive reaction with the AccuProbe DNA probe hybridization test. The clinical importance of this bacterium is currently unknown. We report the characteristics and associated clinical data of 35 strains of S. pseudopneumoniae isolated from sputum samples from 33 patients. All isolates produced a positive result with the NOW S. pneumoniae antigen test (Binax, Inc.). No isolate was resistant to penicillin, but 60{\%} were resistant to erythromycin and 77{\%} were resistant to tetracycline. All patients had lower respiratory tract symptoms, 79{\%} had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 33{\%} had chest radiographic infiltrates. Compared with matched control patients who had Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from sputum, patients with S. pseudopneumoniae infection were more likely to have a history of COPD (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.67 to 20.11) or exacerbation of COPD (OR, 6.5; 95{\%} CI, 2.61 to 16.20).

abstract = {Background: Acute otitis media is one of the most commonly-diagnosed childhood infections. This study assessed the efficacy of a novel vaccine that contained polysaccharides from 11 different Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes each conjugated to Haemophilus influenzae-derived protein D in prevention of acute otitis media. Methods: 4968 infants were randomly assigned to receive either pneumococcal protein D conjugate or hepatitis A vaccine at the ages of 3, 4, 5, and 12-15 months and were followed-up until the end of the second year of life. Middle-ear fluid was obtained for bacteriological culture and serotyping in children who presented with abnormal tympanic membrane or presence of middle-ear effusion, plus two predefined clinical symptoms. The primary endpoint was protective efficacy against the first episode of acute otitis media caused by vaccine pneumococcal serotypes. Analysis was per protocol. Findings: From 2 weeks after the third dose to 24-27 months of age, 333 clinical episodes of acute otitis media were recorded in the protein D conjugate group (n=2455) and 499 in the control group (n=2452), giving a significant (33.6{\%} [95{\%} CI 20.8-44.3]) reduction in the overall incidence of acute otitis media. Vaccine efficacy was shown for episodes of acute otitis media caused by pneumococcal vaccine serotypes (52.6{\%}[35.0-65.5] for the first episode and 57.6{\%} [41.4-69.3] for any episode). Efficacy was also shown against episodes of acute otitis media caused by non-typable H influenzae (35.3{\%} [1.8-57.4]). The vaccine reduced frequency of infection from vaccine-related cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes by 65.5{\%}, but did not significantly change the number of episodes caused by other non-vaccine serotypes. Interpretation: These results confirm that using the H influenzae-derived protein D as a carrier protein for pneumococcal polysaccharides not only allowed protection against pneumococcal otitis, but also against acute otitis media due to non-typable H influenzae. Whether this approach would also allow improved protection against lower respiratory tract infections warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Acute otitis media (AOM) is both a commonly diagnosed condition and a frequent indication for antibiotic use in children. Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are not needed in many children with AOM, as most cases resolve spontaneously without complication. However, a majority of AOM infections in children are still treated with antibiotics. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians released a guideline for treatment of AOM in children. We review the guideline as well as scientific evidence related to AOM treatment options. We support a set of evidence-based guidelines employing a delayed prescription option for antibiotic therapy in selected children. If used appropriately, these cost-effective guidelines will reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed, increase parental satisfaction, and may lower rates of antibiotic resistance while producing similar rates of resolution of AOM.},

abstract = {Objectives: The Ear infections Attitudes Research study investigated parental attitudes and awareness towards acute otitis media (AOM) and evaluated the burden of AOM for affected children, their families, and parental work capabilities. Methods: This study, conducted via online interviews in October-November 2010, included parents (N=2867) from 12 countries, whose children aged ???3.5 years had experienced ???1 professionally diagnosed AOM episode in the last 6 months (AOM-experienced group; N=1438) or had never experienced any professionally diagnosed AOM episode (non AOM-experienced group; N=1429). The interviews consisted of questions with multiple-choice, five-point scaled or free-text answers. Answers to multiple-choice questions were presented as frequencies of particular responses and those to scaled questions as mean values or percentages of parents considering each aspect as applicable. Results: Parents considered that the main AOM burdens for affected children were pain (mean values on five-point scales: 4.4 and 4.5), disturbed sleep (4.3 and 4.3) and irritability (4.2 and 4.0) and for their families, sleepless nights (4.2 and 3.8) and worries about the child's recovery (4.1 and 4.3) and about potential long-term implications (4.0 and 4.3) in the AOM-experienced and non AOM-experienced groups, respectively. During their child's most recent AOM episode, 95{\%} of parents in the AOM-experienced group used antibiotics, 76{\%} reported that their doctors prescribed antibiotics for immediate use, 13{\%} were advised to return for antibiotic prescription if symptoms did not abate and 9{\%} received a prescription for antibiotics to use if symptoms did not improve. Both reported prescription and usage rates for antibiotics were higher than expected. When their child had AOM, 73{\%} of parents had to be absent from work or rearrange their working hours. Among those who took leave from work, 67{\%} stayed at home for 2-7 days. Conclusions: Parents perceive AOM to be a burden for their child and families, particularly the pain and disturbed sleep due to AOM, and this disease had a significant effect on parents' ability to attend work. Given how common AOM is, this loss of workdays may lead to substantial financial burden for families and the society. Antibiotics were almost invariably used in all countries despite current guidelines. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Acute otitis media (AOM) is a major public health concern. This frequent disease of childhood is a leading cause of physician visits, a major component of paediatric healthcare burden, and a key contributor to antibiotic resistance. An international expert group comprising mainly ear, nose, and throat physicians met in June 2008 to discuss the optimal management of AOM, particularly with regards to unmet needs in diagnosis and management. Current guidelines do not help identify which patients are most at risk for severe or complicated AOM. Diagnosis of AOM is also complicated by a lack of correlation between clinical signs and symptoms and responsible pathogens. Consequently, treatment of AOM is not always appropriate, and the long-term overuse of antibiotics in AOM reduces the effectiveness of treatment and places children at risk for drug-resistant infections. There is a need for educational and research initiatives to improve diagnostic accuracy and management of AOM. Because there is currently no ideal treatment, vaccination is an attractive additional approach for managing AOM and reducing its burden. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Szucs2005,
abstract = {The economic importance of vaccines lies partly in the burden of disease that can be avoided and partly in the competition for resources between vaccines and other interventions. Up to the 1980s only few economic evaluations had been carried out. Since then the confrontation of most countries with escalating health care costs and tighter budgets have awakened the interest in pharmacoeconomic analysis. Resources used to provide health care are vast but not limitless. When clinicians are asked to participate in decisions for large groups of patients (in a managed care context, in an institution, or at the level of local health authorities), the balance between consumption of resources and the benefits of an intervention is important. Clinicians may use cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies to inform such decisions (but not to make them). Because of differences in methods, the presentation of results, and country-specific parameters, economic evaluations of the same vaccination strategy by different groups may have divergent results. Vaccines differ from classical medicines in at least three ways: firstly, there is a longer tradition of economic evaluations for vaccines than for medicines. Some of the most earliest economic studies were carried out in the field of vaccines in the public health arena. Secondly, comparatively fewer central decision makers need to be convinced as compared to drugs. The reason for this being a more centralised process of recommending vaccines and vaccination policies. Thirdly, externalities are more relevant in the field of vaccines. Such externalities may be positive or negative. Positive externalities are present in the case where herd immunity prevents the spread of the disease in the community. We are now undoubtedly in an era of assessment and accountability for all new technologies in healthcare. However, sufficient economic data are still lacking to support the formulation of health policy and a particular challenge for the future is to conduct further health economic research on immunisation. Specific areas for such study include: effectiveness under field conditions (i.e., not under the conditions of a randomised controlled trial); the real value of economic production losses; the conditions for implementing novel immunization programmes; cost estimates for more ambitious immunization programmes; the economic benefits of combination vaccines. From this research, it will be important to disseminate the data and to adapt the findings to other countries. Nevertheless, the source of funding for research and its application in clinical trials programmes represent some of the practical problems faced by medical economics today within academia and the industry.},

abstract = {To estimate the effect of the introduction of the 7- and 10-valentpneumococcal vaccines in 2006 and 2011, respectively in the Netherlands, we assessed respiratory antibiotic use in one to nine year-old children between 2002 and 2013. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average models were applied to estimate the percentage reduction in respiratory antibiotic use. When compared with the pre-vaccination period, the proportion of respiratory antibiotic prescriptions fell by 4.94{\%} (95{\%} CI: 4.63 to 5.26) and 9.02{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.83 to 14.82) after the introduction of the 7-valent vaccine in children aged three and four years, respectively. After the introduction of the 10-valent vaccine, we observed a reduction of 13.04{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.76 to 22.23), 20.31{\%} (95{\%} CI: 13.50 to 26.58), 16.92{\%} (95{\%} CI: 3.07 to 28.80), 22.34{\%} (95{\%} CI: 3.73 to 37.35), 23.75{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.37 to 40.44) in two, three, four, six and seven year-old children, respectively. Thus, our results indicate a reduction in respiratory antibiotic prescriptions in young children after introduction of the pneumococcal vaccines. As only children in our study population aged one and two years born after March 2011 had received the 10-valent vaccine, the effects of the 10-valent vaccine in children aged three to nine years likely reflect the effects of the 7-valent vaccine and herd immunity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Otitis media with effusion is one of the most frequent diseases in children, and its management requires the attention of general practitioners, pediatricians and ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons. The main complications associated with tympanostomy tube insertion, are: (1) purulent otorrhea (10-26{\{}{\%}{\}} of cases), in which local otic preparations might be effective, and biofilm-resistant tubes may decrease this complication in the future; (2) myringosclerosis (39-65{\{}{\%}{\}} of operated ears), with usually no serious sequelae; (3) segmental atrophy (16-75{\{}{\%}{\}} of cases); (4) atrophic scars and pars flaccida retraction pockets (28 and 21{\{}{\%}{\}} of operated ears, respectively); (5) tympanic membrane perforations (3{\{}{\%}{\}} of cases, although with T-tubes, the incidence may be as high as 24{\{}{\%}{\}}); (6) cholesteatoma (1{\{}{\%}{\}} of cases), although tympanostomy tubes may sometimes prevent, rather than contribute to its development; (7) granulation tissue (5-40{\{}{\%}{\}} of instances), when the duration of tube retention is prolonged.

@article{Hens2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Until recently, mathematical models of person to person infectious diseases transmission had to make assumptions on transmissions enabled by personal contacts by estimating the so-called WAIFW-matrix. In order to better inform such estimates, a population based contact survey has been carried out in Belgium over the period March-May 2006. In contrast to other European surveys conducted simultaneously, each respondent recorded contacts over two days. Special attention was given to holiday periods, and respondents with large numbers of professional contacts. METHODS: Participants kept a paper diary with information on their contacts over two different days. A contact was defined as a two-way conversation of at least three words in each others proximity. The contact information included the age of the contact, gender, location, duration, frequency, and whether or not touching was involved. For data analysis, we used association rules and classification trees. Weighted generalized estimating equations were used to analyze contact frequency while accounting for the correlation between contacts reported on the two different days. A contact surface, expressing the average number of contacts between persons of different ages was obtained by a bivariate smoothing approach and the relation to the so-called next-generation matrix was established. RESULTS: People mostly mixed with people of similar age, or with their offspring, their parents and their grandparents. By imputing professional contacts, the average number of daily contacts increased from 11.84 to 15.70. The number of reported contacts depended heavily on the household size, class size for children and number of professional contacts for adults. Adults living with children had on average 2 daily contacts more than adults living without children. In the holiday period, the daily contact frequency for children and adolescents decreased with about 19{\%} while a similar observation is made for adults in the weekend. These findings can be used to estimate the impact of school closure. CONCLUSION: We conducted a diary based contact survey in Belgium to gain insights in social interactions relevant to the spread of infectious diseases. The resulting contact patterns are useful to improve estimating crucial parameters for infectious disease transmission models.},

@article{Heikkinen2003a,
abstract = {Acute otitis media is usually considered a simple bacterial infection that is treated with antibiotics. However, ample evidence derived from studies ranging from animal experiments to extensive clinical trials supports a crucial role for respiratory viruses in the etiology and pathogenesis of acute otitis media. Viral infection of the upper respiratory mucosa initiates the whole cascade of events that finally leads to the development of acute otitis media as a complication. The pathogenesis of acute otitis media involves a complex interplay between viruses, bacteria, and the host's inflammatory response. In a substantial number of children, viruses can be found in the middle-ear fluid either alone or together with bacteria, and recent studies indicate that at least some viruses actively invade the middle ear. Viruses appear to enhance the inflammatory process in the middle ear, and they may significantly impair the resolution of otitis media. Prevention of the predisposing viral infection by vaccination against the major viruses would probably be the most effective way to prevent acute otitis media. Alternatively, early treatment of the viral infection with specific antiviral agents would also be effective in reducing the occurrence of acute otitis media.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: European disease-specific antibiotic prescribing quality indicators (APQI) were proposed for seven acute indications (bronchitis, upper respiratory infection, cystitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, otitis media and pneumonia): (a) the percentage of patients prescribed an antibiotic; (b) the percentage of patients receiving the guideline recommended antibiotic; (c) the percentage of patients receiving quinolones.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of calculating values for these 21 APQI using primary care databases; and to assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing in office hours and out-of-hours general practice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data was extracted from a morbidity registration network ( http://www.intego.be ) and the out-of-hours service centre in Flanders. Within both databases diagnoses are labelled using the revised second edition of International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2-R) and antibiotic prescriptions using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both databases allow calculation of APQI values and results are similar. Only for cystitis was the percentage of patients prescribed an antibiotic within the proposed acceptable range. For all indications, the percentage of recommended antibiotics was below the proposed acceptable range (80-100{\%}). The percentage of quinolones was within the proposed acceptable range (0-5{\%}) for otitis media, upper respiratory infection and tonsillitis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Primary care databases can produce APQI values. These values revealed huge opportunities to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing in office hours and out-of-hours Flemish general practice, especially the prescription of recommended antibiotics.},

abstract = {Because of its prominence as a cause of disease in humans, Streptococcuspneumoniae has been the subject of intensive investigation at both the clinical level and the basic scientific level during the past century. In a number of instances, these studies have resulted in important progress toward the comprehension of basic biological principles. The areas advanced by studies of the pneumococcus include an understanding of the concept of pathogenesis of infectious disease; the development of Gram's stain for identification of bacteria in specimens from patients; the eluci-dation of the role of the bacterial capsule in resistance to phagocytosis by cells of the host's immune system; the demonstration that molecules other than proteins are capable of eliciting the host's humoral immune responses and later, by extension, that isolated bacterial exopolysacchar-ides can be used safely and effectively as vaccines in humans; the documentation of the efficacy of penicillin; the collection of conclusive evidence that DNA encodes genetic information; and the investigation of putative proteinaceous virulence factors. Data acquired during the course of clinical investigations can often provide the answers to basic biological questions if subjected to critical analysis by insightful researchers. Ample illustrations of this point are found in the abundant reports of investigations involving Streptococcus pneumoniae, an or-ganism of unquestioned clinical importance. Since a variety of recent reviews have focused on different aspects of pneu-mococcal research, we will not attempt an exhaustive sum-mary here; rather, we will direct the reader to detailed re-views where appropriate. In this review we will focus on the ways in which studies of this pathogen have been central to several of the most profoundly influential biological findings of the past 110 years.},

abstract = {Pneumococcal disease causes large morbidity, mortality and health care utilization and medical and non-medical costs, which can all be reduced by effective infant universal routine immunization programs with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV). We evaluated the clinical and economic benefits of such programs with either 10- or 13-valent PCVs in Malaysia and Hong Kong by using an age-stratified Markov cohort model with many country-specific inputs. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was calculated to compare PCV10 or PCV13 against no vaccination and PCV13 against PCV10 over a 10-year birth cohort's vaccination. Both payer and societal perspectives were used. PCV13 had better public health and economic outcomes than a PCV10 program across all scenarios considered. For example, in the base case scenario in Malaysia, PCV13 would reduce more cases of IPD (+2,296), pneumonia (+705,281), and acute otitis media (+376,967) and save more lives (+6,122) than PCV10. Similarly, in Hong Kong, PCV13 would reduce more cases of IPD cases (+529), pneumonia (+172,185), and acute otitis media (+37,727) and save more lives (+2,688) than PCV10. During the same time horizon, PCV13 would gain over 74,000 and 21,600 additional QALYs than PCV10 in Malaysia and Hong Kong, respectively. PCV13 would be cost saving when compared against similar program with PCV10, under both payer and societal perspective in both countries. PCV13 remained a better choice over PCV10 in multiple sensitivity, scenario, and probabilistic analyses. PCV13s broader serotype coverage in its formulation and herd effect compared against PCV10 were important drivers of differences in outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The introduction of a 7-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV7) had profound public health effects across the globe. PCV7 vaccination in a national immunization program is generally considered cost-effective and potentially cost-saving. Two new PCVs have been launched, a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13).

OBJECTIVE: This article examines the public health and economic effects of pediatric national immunization programs of PCV10 and PCV13 in Denmark and Sweden.

METHODS: A previously published decision-analytic model was used to estimate the impact of PCV10 and PCV13 on reducing cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia (PNE), and acute otitis media (AOM) by using country-specific incidence, serotype coverage, disease sequelae, mortality, vaccine effectiveness, indirect effects, costs, and utilities. Direct effects for PCV13- and PCV10-covered serotypes were assumed similar to PCV7. PCV13 was assumed to confer an indirect effect, similar to PCV7, whereas PCV10 was not. Assumptions were tested in sensitivity analyses.

RESULTS: PCV13 is expected to save 280.7 million DKK (Danish kroner) in Denmark and 288.2 million SEK (Swedish kronor) in Sweden in direct costs compared with a vaccination program with PCV10. In both Denmark and Sweden, the results of this study indicate that, compared with PCV10, PCV13 will have a greater impact on disease in life-years gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, IPD cases avoided, PNE cases avoided, AOM cases avoided, and in deaths avoided. For Denmark PCV13, it was estimated to result in 10,051 LYG; 9063 QALYs gained; 237 additional IPD cases avoided; 12,094 additional PNE cases avoided; 958 additional cases of AOM avoided; and 882 additional deaths avoided. For Sweden PCV13, it was estimated to result in 4245 LYG; 3953 QALYs gained; 379 additional IPD cases avoided; 8210 additional PNE cases avoided; 1459 additional cases of AOM avoided; and 378 additional deaths avoided. In all sensitivity analyses, PCV13 was less costly and more effective compared with PCV10.

CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, a national immunization program with PCV13 was found to be good value for money and estimated to prevent additional cases of disease among children and nonvaccinated individuals and save additional costs due to treatment of pneumococcal disease, when compared with PCV10 in Denmark and Sweden.},

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

This review summarises published reports of IPD incidence (1998-2005) among non-immunised individuals in countries with universal PCV7 immunisation. Findings suggest that non-immunised individuals benefit from indirect protection following widespread vaccination, enhancing cost-benefit evaluations of vaccination programs.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate via meta-analysis the comparative efficacy of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate to that of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of children with AOM. METHODS A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts was conducted from the earliest available date through September 2008. We used the following MeSH and key words: amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, Augmentin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, macrolides, AND media, otitis media, and effusion. Included studies were randomized, blinded, and controlled trials evaluating guideline-recommended antibiotics (amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate) compared to macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin or clarithromycin) in AOM in children. The primary outcome assessed was clinical failure measured between days 10 and 16 after starting antibiotic therapy. Results are reported as relative risks (RRs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals and were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS A total of 10 trials (N = 2766) evaluating children 6 months-15 years old were included in the meta-analysis. Upon meta-analysis, the use of macrolide antibiotics was associated with an increased risk of clinical failure (RR 1.31 [95{\%} CI 1.07 to 1.60]; p = 0.008) corresponding to a number needed to harm of 32. Upon safety analysis, rates of any adverse reaction (RR 0.74 [95{\%} CI 0.60 to 0.90]; p = 0.003) and diarrhea (RR 0.41 [95{\%} CI 0.32 to 0.52]; p {\textless} 0.0001) were significantly lower in the macrolide group. CONCLUSIONS The meta-analysis suggests that patients treated with macrolides for AOM may be more likely to have clinical failures. As such, it supports the current AAP AOM recommendation that macrolides be reserved for patients who can not receive amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyse an Italian database of spontaneous reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions in order to compare the safety profile of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the spontaneous reports collected by six Italian regions (the GIF database) from January 1988 to June 2005. Drug utilization data were also available for the two drugs. The comparison between amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was made using the chi(2) or Student's t-test, when appropriate. Disproportionality in reporting of adverse events was assessed using reporting odds ratio methodology. RESULTS: Up to June 2005, the GIF database collected 37 906 reports, of which 1088 were related to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 1095 to amoxicillin. The percentage of skin reactions was statistically higher for amoxicillin (82{\%}) than for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (76{\%}); on the contrary, the percentage of gastrointestinal, hepatic and haematological reactions was significantly higher for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (13{\%}, 4{\%} and 2{\%}, respectively) than for amoxicillin (7{\%}, 1{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively). Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid seems to be associated with a higher risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, purpura and hepatitis than amoxicillin alone. In particular, the reporting rate of hepatitis is on average 9-fold higher for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid than for amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis shows a different safety profile for the two selected drugs. The combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been increasingly used in Italy and now represents the most frequently antibiotic prescribed by Italian general practitioners. Given the documented level of inappropriate use of beta-lactams in Italy, these results should be taken into account by physicians before prescribing amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to patients.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for prevention of AOM in children age 12 years and younger. METHODS: Systematic review of 11 randomized controlled trials including 46 074 children in whom pneumococcal vaccination against AOM was compared with a control treatment. Vaccine effect was estimated as a rate ratio (RR): AOM episodes per child month in pneumococcal vaccination group divided by the AOM episodes per child-month in control group. RESULTS: A moderate effect of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination was found in children 24 months of age and older [RR 0.78; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.97]. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine had little effect on prevention of AOM in children without previous documented episodes before vaccination (RR 0.92; 95{\%} CI 0.85 to 0.99). Better efficacy was seen in those children with documented prior AOM before vaccination (RR 0.81; 95{\%} CI 0.72 to 0.91). Pooled results of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trials in infants vaccinated as early as 2 months of age and in toddlers attending day care showed only a small effect on prevention of AOM (RR 0.92; 95{\%} CI 0.85 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, a large scale pneumococcal vaccination program for a primary indication of preventing AOM in infancy is not indicated. The results of ongoing trials should provide more information whether the conjugate vaccine is effective in high risk (otitis-prone) children after 1 year of age.},

METHODS: Data from Australia (N = 2000-2001, max 25 diagnosis codes), Canada (N = 2002-2003, max 16 diagnosis codes), Switzerland (N = 1999-2001, unlimited number of diagnosis codes), and Japan (N = 2003, max 11 diagnosis codes) were analyzed. Only the first admission for patients age 18 years and older, with a length of stay of {\textgreater}/=2 days was included. For each algorithm, 2 logistic regression models were fitted with hospital mortality as the outcome and the Charlson individual comorbidities or the Charlson index score as independent variables. The c-statistic (representing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and its 95{\%} probability bootstrap distribution were employed to evaluate model performance. RESULTS: Overall, within each population's data, the distribution of comorbidity level categories was similar across the 3 translations. The Quan version produced slightly higher median c-statistics than the Halfon or Sundararajan versions in all datasets. For example, in Japanese data, the median c-statistics were 0.712 (Quan), 0.709 (Sundararajan), and 0.694 (Halfon) using individual comorbidity coefficients. In general, the probability distributions between the Quan and the Sundararajan versions overlapped, whereas those between the Quan and the Halfon version did not. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses show that all of the ICD-10 versions of the Charlson algorithm performed satisfactorily (c-statistics 0.70-0.86), with the Quan version showing a trend toward outperforming the other versions in all data sets.},

abstract = {We have identified an unusual group of viridans group streptococci that resemble Streptococcus pneumoniae. DNA-DNA homology studies suggested that a subset of these isolates represent a novel species that may be included in the S. oralis-S. mitis group of viridans group streptococci. We suggest that this novel species be termed Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. A combination of phenotypic and genetic reactions allows its identification. S. pseudopneumoniae strains do not have pneumococcal capsules, are resistant to optochin (inhibition zones, less than 14 mm) when they are incubated under an atmosphere of increased CO2 but are susceptible to optochin (inhibition zones, {\textgreater}14 mm) when they are incubated in ambient atmospheres, are not soluble in bile, and are positive by the GenProbe AccuProbe Pneumococcus test. The bile solubility test is more specific than the optochin test for identification of S. pneumoniae. Genetic tests for pneumolysin (ply) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (sodA) and identification tests with a commercial probe, AccuProbe Pneumococcus, do not discriminate between the new species and S. pneumoniae.},

abstract = {An international consultation was convened in March 2012 to provide feedback on the Case for Carriage, a summary statement by the Pneumococcal Carriage Consortium (PneumoCarr) proposing nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization as a supplementary or alternative endpoint in vaccine licensure. PneumoCarr members provided information to vaccine manufacturers, regulators and the WHO on the evidence for NP carriage as a precursor to pneumococcal disease, standardization of laboratory methods for the detection of multiple serotype carriage, definition and estimation of pneumococcal vaccine efficacy against carriage (VE-col), and the direct and indirect impact of vaccination on carriage. Manufacturers and regulators had the opportunity to respond to the information compiled by PneumoCarr and share their perspectives. VE-col as a licensure endpoint may be more useful for the next generation pneumococcal vaccine products, particularly those for which the immunological correlate of protection is not established, whereas it may be less needed for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines which have an established licensure pathway. The consultation supported the importance of NP carriage data as a critical element linking vaccine impact on the individual direct risk of disease to the population-level impact: indirect effects such as herd protection and serotype replacement. The indirect effects of vaccination, however, are not currently established as part of the licensure process and to include them would be a paradigm shift for regulatory agencies who currently consider this information in the post-licensure setting. More discussion and consensus-building is needed around the rationale and optimal mechanism to include carriage data in the licensure pathway for new pneumococcal vaccines. The WHO and national advisory groups on immunization policy may have an important role in considering the evidence for the indirect benefit of vaccination as informed by its impact on NP carriage. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibiotic prophylaxis given before invasive dental procedures in patients at risk of developing infective endocarditis has historically been the focus of infective endocarditis prevention. Recent changes in antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines in the USA and Europe have substantially reduced the number of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. In the UK, guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis in March, 2008. We aimed to investigate changes in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of infective endocarditis since the introduction of these guidelines. METHODS: We did a retrospective secular trend study, analysed as an interrupted time series, to investigate the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis on the incidence of infective endocarditis in England. We analysed data for the prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis from Jan 1, 2004, to March 31, 2013, and hospital discharge episode statistics for patients with a primary diagnosis of infective endocarditis from Jan 1, 2000, to March 31, 2013. We compared the incidence of infective endocarditis before and after the introduction of the NICE guidelines using segmented regression analysis of the interrupted time series. FINDINGS: Prescriptions of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis fell substantially after introduction of the NICE guidance (mean 10,900 prescriptions per month [Jan 1, 2004, to March 31, 2008] vs 2236 prescriptions per month [April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2013], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Starting in March, 2008, the number of cases of infective endocarditis increased significantly above the projected historical trend, by 0{\textperiodcentered}11 cases per 10 million people per month (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}05-0{\textperiodcentered}16, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). By March, 2013, 35 more cases per month were reported than would have been expected had the previous trend continued. This increase in the incidence of infective endocarditis was significant for both individuals at high risk of infective endocarditis and those at lower risk. INTERPRETATION: Although our data do not establish a causal association, prescriptions of antibiotic prophylaxis have fallen substantially and the incidence of infective endocarditis has increased significantly in England since introduction of the 2008 NICE guidelines.

abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant pneumococci, especially penicillin-resistant strains, are being increasingly isolated. Pneumococci with intermediate penicillin-resistance (MIC 0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml) have been reported from many parts of the world over the past two decades, and highly resistant strains (penicillin MICs greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) have also appeared. Infection may be acquired in the hospital or community, and nosocomial outbreaks may occur which require control measures to limit organism spread. Most infections occur in children with diminished host responses. Disease caused by pneumococci with intermediate penicillin-resistance may be treated with high doses of penicillin, but disease caused by highly resistant strains, especially meningitis, may require alternative therapy. Pneumococci resistant to sulfonamides, tetracyclines, erythromycin, lincomycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and rifampin have also appeared. Strains resistant to all the above-mentioned agents, including all beta-lactam antibiotics tested, have been reported from South Africa and Spain. Alternative therapy for resistant strains may include vancomycin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone and imipenem. Pneumococci isolated from sites suggestive of infection, especially blood and cerebrospinal fluid, should be routinely tested for penicillin-susceptibility.},

abstract = {Antibiotic overconsumption is the main force driving the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. To promote better antibiotic use in France, a nationwide campaign has been run every year from October to March since 2002. In 2007, it was shown that winter outpatient antibiotic consumption had decreased by 26.5{\%} compared to the 2000-2002 baseline period. Here, we quantified outpatient antibiotic use between 2000 and 2010 as a follow-up analysis of the nationwide campaign. Reimbursed outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were extracted from computerized French National Health Insurance databases. Entire series and age group and antibiotic class analyses were computed. Time series analyses used autoregressive moving-average models with exogenous variables and intervention functions. Two periods were considered: October to March “campaign” periods and April to September “warm” periods. Compared to the precampaign (2000-2002) baseline period, the numbers of weekly antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants during campaign periods decreased until winter 2006 to 2007 (−30{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, −36.3 to −23.8{\%}]; P {\textless} 0.001) and then stabilized except for individuals {\textgreater}60 years of age, for whom prescriptions reached the precampaign level. During the warm periods from April to September, no significant differences were estimated compared to the baseline level for the entire series, but seniors had an increasing trend that became significant as of 2005, reaching +21{\%} (95{\%} CI, +12.9 to +29.6{\%}) in 2009 ( P {\textless} 0.0001). These results highlight the need for a better understanding of antibiotic use by the elderly, requiring research with targeted and tailored public health actions for this population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed to replace the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) based on serological noninferiority criteria. To date no randomized PCV13 pediatric trial has included clinical endpoints. METHODS: This randomized double-blind trial compared the impact of PCV13 versus PCV7 on nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization and immunogenicity. Healthy infants were randomized (1:1) to receive PCV7 or PCV13 at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12 months; NP swabs were collected at 2, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, and 24 months, and blood was drawn at 7 and 13 months. Rates of NP acquisition and prevalence, and serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations were assessed. RESULTS: The per protocol analysis population included 881 PCV13 and 873 PCV7 recipients. PCV13 significantly reduced NP acquisition of the additional PCV13 serotypes 1, 6A, 7F, and 19A; the cross-reacting serotype 6C; and the common PCV7 serotype 19F. For serotype 3, and the other PCV7 serotypes, there were no significant differences between the vaccine groups. There were too few serotype 5 events to draw inference. The impact on prevalence at predefined time points was similar to that observed with NP acquisition. PCV13 elicited significantly higher IgG responses for PCV13 additional serotypes and serotype 19F, and similar or lower responses for 6/7 PCV7 serotypes. CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 resulted in lower acquisition and prevalence of NP colonization than PCV7 did for 4 additional PCV13 serotypes, and serotypes 6C and 19F. It was comparable with PCV7 for all other common serotypes. These findings predict vaccine effectiveness through both direct and indirect protection. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT00508742.},

abstract = {Background: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) protects against key serotypes that increased after routine immunisation with the seven-valent vaccine (PCV7), but its potential for herd protection and serotype replacement is uncertain. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales 4 years after its introduction. Methods: We used a national dataset of electronically reported and serotyped invasive pneumococcal disease cases in England and Wales to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for vaccine and non-vaccine type invasive pneumococcal disease between July, 2013, and June, 2014, versus the pre-PCV13 and pre-PCV7 baseline. Incidence rates were corrected for missing serotype data and changes in surveillance sensitivity over time. An over-dispersed Poisson model was used to estimate IRRs and confidence intervals. Findings: Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in the epidemiological year 2013/14 decreased by 32{\%} compared with the pre-PCV13 baseline (incidence 10??14 per 100 000 in 2008-10 vs 6??85 per 100 000 in 2013/14; IRR 0??68, 95{\%} CI 0??64-0??72). This was due to an 86{\%} reduction of the serotypes covered by PCV7 (1??46 vs 0??20 per 100 000; IRR 0??14, 0??10-0??18) and a 69{\%} reduction of the additional six serotypes covered by PCV13 (4??48 vs 1??40 per 100 000; IRR 0??31, 0??28-0??35). When compared with the pre-PCV7 baseline, there was a 56{\%} overall reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease (15??63 vs 6??85 per 100 000; IRR 0??44, 95{\%} CI 0??43-0??47). Compared with the pre-PCV13 baseline, the incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes increased (incidence all ages 4??19 vs 5??25 per 100 000; IRR 1??25, 95{\%} CI 1??17-1??35) due to increases across a broad range of serotypes in children younger than 5 years and in people aged 45 years or more. In children younger than 5 years, incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes in 2013/14 was higher than in 2012/13 (age {\textless}2 years: 12??03 vs 10??83 per 100 000; age 2-4 years: 4??08 vs 3??63 per 100 000). Interpretation: 8 years of PCV use in England and Wales has reduced the overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease by more than 50{\%}. The herd protection induced by PCV7 is continuing, and similar indirect protection is occurring from the additional serotypes covered by PCV13. There is, however, evidence of increasing invasive pneumococcal disease due to non-PCV13 serotypes, particularly in children younger than 5 years in 2014. If this increase continues, the maximum benefit of the PCV13 programme in children might already have been achieved.

Comparison of closely related isolates showed the role of transformation in facilitating capsule switching to non-vaccine serotypes and the emergence of drug resistance. However, such recombination was found to occur at significantly different rates across the species, and the evolution of the population was primarily driven by changes in the frequency of distinct genotypes extant before the introduction of the vaccine. These alterations resulted in little overall effect on accessory genome composition at the population level, contrasting with the decrease in pneumococcal disease rates after the vaccine's introduction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric respiratory infections caused by antibiotic-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (ANSP) continue to present an important challenge, even after introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). This randomized double-blind trial assessed the potential additional impact of PCV13 over PCV7 on reducing ANSP carriage. METHODS: Healthy infants were randomly assigned to receive PCV13 (n = 932) or PCV7 (n = 934) at ages 2, 4, 6, or 12 months. Eight nasopharyngeal specimens were collected by swabbing between ages 2 and 24 months. S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method and the Etest. Nasopharyngeal acquisition and prevalence of ANSP during ages 7-24 months were compared between the 2 vaccine groups. RESULTS: In general, new acquisition of pneumococci nonsusceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, penicillin plus erythromycin, and multiple drugs (≥3 antibiotics) was significantly lower in the PCV13 group compared with the PCV7 group; the main serotypes contributing to this significant decrease were serotype 19F, present in PCV13 and PCV7, and serotypes 6A and 19A, present in PCV13 only. CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 has a significant added benefit over PCV7 in reducing carriage of ANSP. Because carriage determines transmission, these results suggest that PCV13 will provide protection against ANSP disease that exceeds protection provided by PCV7. Clinical Trials Registration.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compile and evaluate the evidence on the effects on health and social outcomes of computer based peer to peer communities and electronic self support groups, used by people to discuss health related issues remotely. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES Analysis of studies identified from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Electronics and Communications Abstracts, Computer and Information Systems Abstracts, ERIC, LISA, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, Web of Science. SELECTION OF STUDIES We searched for before and after studies, interrupted time series, cohort studies, or studies with control groups; evaluating health or social outcomes of virtual peer to peer communities, either as stand alone interventions or in the context of more complex systems with peer to peer components. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Peer to peer interventions and co-interventions studied, general characteristics of studies, outcome measures used, and study results. RESULTS 45 publications describing 38 distinct studies met our inclusion criteria: 20 randomised trials, three meta-analyses of n of 1 trials, three non-randomised controlled trials, one cohort study, and 11 before and after studies. Only six of these evaluated "pure" peer to peer communities, and one had a factorial design with a "peer to peer only" arm, whereas 31 studies evaluated complex interventions, which often included psychoeducational programmes or one to one communication with healthcare professionals, making it impossible to attribute intervention effects to the peer to peer community component. The outcomes measured most often were depression and social support measures; most studies did not show an effect. We found no evidence to support concerns over virtual communities harming people. CONCLUSIONS No robust evidence exists of consumer led peer to peer communities, partly because most peer to peer communities have been evaluated only in conjunction with more complex interventions or involvement with health professionals. Given the abundance of unmoderated peer to peer groups on the internet, research is required to evaluate under which conditions and for whom electronic support groups are effective and how effectiveness in delivering social support electronically can be maximised.},

abstract = {The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) was licensed in Norway in 2001. In July 2006, PCV-7 was introduced in the Norwegian Childhood Vaccination Programme in a 2+1 dose schedule, with immunizations administered at 3, 5 and 12 months of age. PCV-7 was offered through the vaccination programme to all children born from January 2006, i.e. a catch-up for children aged 3-6 months. Prior to 2006 the use of PCV-7 was negligible. The effectiveness of the PCV-7 vaccination programme was assessed using data on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence obtained from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases, serotype distribution from the National Reference Laboratory for Pneumococci, and vaccine coverage and vaccination status from the Norwegian National Vaccination Register. Vaccine coverage quickly reached high levels; 95{\%} of children {\textgreater}3 months born from January 2006 had received at least one immunization with PCV-7. The incidence rate of IPD among children {\textless}2 years rapidly declined; the rate of vaccine serotype IPD in this age group fell from an average of 47.1 cases/100,000 population in the 2 years prior to PCV-7 introduction to 13.7 cases/100,000 population in 2007. The incidence rate of nonvaccine serotype IPD remained stable. The vaccine programme effectiveness was estimated to be 74{\%} (95{\%} CI 57-85{\%}). No vaccine failure was seen after complete primary immunization with two vaccine doses. Our findings indicate that PCV-7 provides highly effective protection against vaccine serotype IPD when administered in a 2+1 dose schedule.},

An up-to-date evidence base on the effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) on infectious diseases and mortality in any population or setting regardless of age or health status is currently lacking. METHODS We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently screened 9498 titles/abstracts and 430 full-text papers for eligible trials. The outcomes of our meta-analysis were pooled using relative risks (RRs) with a random effects model or Peto's odds ratios (ORs) if event rates were :lt;1{\%}. RESULTS 21 RCTs comprising 361 612 individuals were included. PCVs reduced the risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: [0.36; 0.51]), all-cause acute otitis media (AOM) (RR: 0.93, 95{\%} CI: [0.86; 1.00]), pneumococcal AOM (RR: 0.57, 95{\%} CI: [0.39; 0.83]), allcause pneumonia (RR: 0.93, 95{\%} CI: [0.89; 0.97]), and pneumococcal pneumonia (RR: 0.78, 95{\%} CI: [0.62; 0.97]). We found no significant effect of PCVs on all-cause mortality (RR: 0.95, 95{\%} CI: [0.88; 1.03]) or recurrent AOM (RR: 0.87, 95{\%} CI: [0.72; 1.05]). CONCLUSION PCVs are associated with large risk reductions for pneumococcal infectious diseases, smaller risk reductions for infectious diseases from any cause, and no significant effect on all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Since the initial discovery of RSV-A ON1 in Canada in 2010, ON1 has been reported worldwide, yet information regarding its clinical impact and severity has been controversial. To investigate the clinical relevance of RSV-A ON1,acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases enrolled to our population-based prospective pediatric ARI surveillance at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Central Vietnam from January 2010 through December 2012 were studied. Clinical-epidemiological information and nasopharyngeal samples were collected. Multiplex PCR assays were performed for screening 13 respiratory viruses. RSV-positive samples were further tested for subgroups (A/B) and genotypes information by sequencing the G-glycoprotein 2nd hypervariable region. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of RSV-A ON1. A total of 1854 ARI cases were enrolled and 426 (23.0{\%}) of them were RSV-positive. During the study period, RSV-A and B had been co-circulating. NA1 was the predominant RSV-A genotype until the appearance of ON1 in 2012. RSV-related ARI hospitalization incidence significantly increased after the emergence of ON1. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that risk of lower respiratory tract infection was 2.26 (95{\%} CI: 1.37-3.72) times, and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia was 1.98 (95{\%} CI: 1.01-3.87) times greater in ON1 compared to NA1 cases. Our result suggested that ON1 ARI cases were clinically more severe than NA1.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The short-term impact of childhood invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) on quality-of-life (QoL) remains largely unquantified. This study aimed to quantify QoL loss at the point when illness was at its worst, and assess health state recovery in the months following illness. METHODS Parents of children aged {\textless}16 years with laboratory-confirmed meningococcal group B (MenB) disease in England, with onset dates from November 2012 to May 2013 were asked to complete a short questionnaire, which included EQ-5DY, a version of EQ-5D for 8-15 year-olds. The parents, or child if able, were asked to complete the questionnaires while considering the child's health on the worst day of illness and on the date the questionnaires were completed. RESULTS The overall response rate was 43{\%} (109/254 children), with no significant differences between respondents and non-respondents. The median time from disease onset to questionnaire completion was 134 days (interquartile range (IQR), 92 to 156 days). After imputation, the median health index was -0.056 (IQR, -0.073 to 0.102) on the worst day of illness, and 1 (IQR 0.866 to 1.000) on the date of questionnaire completion. The respective Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) were 6.5/100.0 (IQR, 0.0 to 20.0) and 95.0/100.0 (IQR, 90.0 to 100.0). The health state of cases with long-term sequelae (n = 41) was significantly worse at follow-up than those who recovered uneventfully (n = 64; 90.0 vs. 98.0; p{\textless}0.001), although there was no significant difference on the worst day of illness (5.0 vs. 10.0; p = 0.671). CONCLUSIONS This work has provided, for the first time, a quantitative estimate of QoL loss at the peak of illness and in the months after MenB disease in children. The magnitude of QoL loss is staggering, with the reported health state being at, or close to, the worst possible outcome imaginable. This study highlights the difficulties in measuring the impact of illness in young children, who often have the highest burden of potentially preventable infectious diseases.},

abstract = {After introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in the infant national immunization program (NIP) in the Netherlands in 2006, Streptococcus pneumoniae strains of the non-vaccine serotype 19A emerged and became the dominant serotype in carriage in children and their parents. Similar patterns were observed in other European countries and the United States. Increases in carriage rates of Staphylococcus aureus and non-typeable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae were also observed. After switching of PCV7 to 10-valent vaccine (PCV10) in 2011, a new carriage surveillance study was performed in the winter of 2012/2013. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis was determined by conventional culture in 330 PCV10-vaccinated 11-month-old children, 330 PCV7-vaccinated 24-month-old children, and their parents. Carriage prevalence was compared with similar carriage studies conducted in 2005, 2009, and 2010/2011. Although serotype 19A remained the most frequently carried pneumococcal serotype in children, prevalence of 19A significantly declined in PCV7-vaccinated 24-month-old children (14{\%} to 8{\%}, p= 0.01), but less in PCV10-vaccinated 11-month-old children (12{\%} to 9{\%}, p= 0.31). Carriage of H. influenzae remained stable at an elevated level (65{\%} in 11-month-olds and 69{\%} in 24-month-olds), while the carriage of S. aureus returned to pre-PCV7 levels in 11-month-old children (14{\%} in 2010/2011 to 7{\%} in 2012/2013), but not in 24-month-olds (remained at 7{\%}). Our results might indicate a new balance between replacing non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and other potential pathogenic bacteria in nasopharyngeal carriage. Carriage studies are valuable tools in assessing vaccine effects on pathogens circulating in the population, for evaluation of PCV impact, and in predicting changes in respiratory and invasive disease.},

In particular, no population-based study in upper-middle income countries is available. In 2010, Brazil introduced PCV10 into its routine National Immunization Program using a 3+1 schedule. We measured the impact of PCV10 on all-cause OM in children. An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted in Goi{\^{a}}nia/Brazil considering monthly rates (per 100,000) of all-cause OM outpatient visits in children aged 2-23 months. We used case-based data from the Outpatient Visits Information System of the Unified Health System coded for ICD-10 diagnosis for the period of August/2008 to July/2015. As a comparator, we used rates of outpatient visits due to all-other causes. The relative reduction of all-cause OM and all-other causes of outpatient visits were calculated as the difference between the predicted and observed cumulative rates of the PCV10 post-vaccination period. We then subtracted the relative reduction of all-other causes of outpatient visits from all-cause OM to obtain the impact of PCV10 on OM. In total, 6,401 OM outpatient visits were recorded in 4,793 children aged 2-23 months. Of these, 922 (19.2{\%}) children had more than one OM episode. A significant reduction in all-cause OM visits was observed (50.7{\%}; 95{\%}CI: 42.2-59.2{\%}; p = 0.013), while the reduction in visits due to all-other causes was 7.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.8-14.7{\%}; p{\textless}0.001). The impact of PCV10 on all-cause OM was thus estimated at 43.0{\%} (95{\%}CI 41.4-44.5). This is the first study to show significant PCV10 impact on OM outpatient visits in infants in a developing country. Our findings corroborate the available evidence from developed countries.},

For two of these methods, interactions between age groups were parameterized using empirical social contact data whereas for the third method we used the current standard approach of imposing a simplifying structure on the 'Who Acquires Infection From Whom' (WAIFW) matrix. The first method was based on solving a set of differential equations to obtain an equilibrium value of the proportion of susceptibles. The second method was based on finding a solution for the age-specific force of infection using the formula of the mass action principle by means of iteration. Both solutions were contrasted with observed age-specific seroprevalence data. The best fit of the WAIFW matrix was obtained with contacts involving touching, and lasting longer than 15 min per day. Plausible values for R0 for varicella in Belgium ranged from 7.66 to 13.44. Both approaches based on empirical social contact data provided a better fit to seroprevalence data than the current standard approach. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {AIM: We conducted a study to determine whether administration of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to toddlers attending day-care centers (DCCs) could prevent acquisition of Streptococcus pneumoniae of the vaccine serotypes (VT) by their younger siblings. METHODS: In a double blind study, 262 DCC attendees ages 12 to 35 months were randomized to receive a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PnCRM9; n = 132), or a control vaccine (meningococcus C vaccine; n = 130). It was planned to follow the groups for 2 years with monthly nasopharyngeal pneumococcal cultures during the first follow-up year and every 2 months during the second year. Forty-six younger siblings of the above described children, age {\textless}18 months (23 siblings of the PnCRM9 recipients and 23 of the controls), were also enrolled, and nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained monthly until the children reached the age of 18 months or started to attend DCC, if before the age of 18 months. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: Of the 3748 cultures obtained from the DCC attendees, 2450 (65{\%}) were positive for S. pneumoniae. Of 306 cultures obtained from the younger siblings, 151 (49{\%}) were positive. Among the PnCRM9 recipients, cultures were significantly less frequently positive for the VT S. pneumoniae than among the controls (13{\%} vs. 21{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). The same pattern was seen in the younger siblings of PnCRM9 recipients vs. the siblings of controls (21{\%} vs. 34{\%}, respectively; P = 0.017). The reverse trend was seen for non-VT strains in both the DCC attendees (44{\%} vs. 34{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001) and their younger siblings (19{\%} vs. 13{\%}, respectively; P = 0.15). There was a significant decrease in the carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae in both the PnCRM9 recipients and their younger siblings. The relative risks (and 95{\%} confidence intervals) to carry S. pneumoniae penicillin-nonsusceptible, resistant to {\textgreater} or =1, {\textgreater} or =2 and {\textgreater} or =3 antibiotic categories among younger siblings of PnCRM9 recipients vs. siblings of controls were 0.47 (0.31 to 0.70), 0.49 (0.33 to 0.71), 0.46 (0.30 to 0.73) and 0.49 (0.21 to 1.17), respectively. When acquired, VT and antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae were carried for a significantly shorter period of time among siblings of PnCRM9 recipients than in siblings of controls. CONCLUSION: The marked effect of PnCRM9 administration to DCC attendees on carriage of VT and antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae among their younger household close contacts demonstrates a herd effect of the vaccine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006.Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial. The effectiveness of antihistamines, decongestants and antihistamine/decongestant combinations in promoting the resolution of effusions has been assessed by randomized controlled trials. OBJECTIVES The objective of this review was to determine whether antihistamine, decongestant or combination therapy is effective in treating children who present with OME. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 1 February 2011, following a previous search in 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using antihistamines, decongestants or antihistamine/decongestant combinations as treatment for OME in children. We excluded trials that randomized on the basis of acute otitis media (AOM) even though OME was also studied in follow up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted data from the published reports using standardized data extraction forms and methods. The two authors assessed the methodological quality of the included studies independently. We expressed dichotomous results as a risk ratio with 95{\%} confidence intervals using a fixed-effect model when homogeneous and a random-effects model when heterogeneous. Nearly all outcomes analyzed were homogeneous. We discussed continuous results qualitatively. We conducted statistical analysis using RevMan 5.1 software. MAIN RESULTS Sixteen studies (1880 participants) were included in the review. No statistical or clinical benefit was found for any of the interventions or outcomes studied. However, treated study subjects experienced 11{\%} more side effects than untreated subjects (number needed to treat to harm = 9). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The pooled data demonstrate no benefit and some harm from the use of antihistamines or decongestants alone or in combination in the management of OME, therefore we recommend against their use.},

abstract = {Background. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of acute otitis media (AOM) in young children. More than 90 immunologically distinct pneumococcal serotypes have been identified, but limited information is available regarding their relative importance in AOM. Methods. We analyzed nine existing datasets comprising pneumococcal isolates from middle ear fluid samples collected from 1994 through 2000 from 3232 children with AOM from Finland, France, Greece, Israel, several East European countries, the US and Argentina. We examined the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in relation to several demographic and epidemio-logic variables, including gender, age, antibiotic resistance and source of culture material. Results. The major serotypes identified in-cluded 19F and 23F, each comprising 13 to 25{\%} of pneumococcal middle ear fluid isolates in most datasets; 14 and 6B, comprising 6 to 18{\%}; whereas 6A, 19A and 9V each comprised 5 to 10{\%}. Despite differences in location, study design and antibi-otic susceptibility, each major serotype was prominent in most age groups of each dataset. Serotypes represented in the 7-valent pneumo-coccal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7, 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) accounted for 60 to 70{\%} of all pneumococcal isolates in the 6-to 59-month age range, but only 40 to 50{\%} of isolates in children {\textless}6 or {\textgreater}60 months old. Serotype 3 and, in certain datasets, serotypes 1 and 5, were more important in the {\textless}6-and {\textgreater}60-month age groups. In each age group vaccine-related serotypes (mainly 6A and 19A) comprised an additional 10 to 15{\%} of all pneumococcal isolates. Four serotypes (23F, 19F, 14 and 6B) accounted for 83{\%} of all penicillin-resistant observations. Conclusions. This analysis of several geograph-ically diverse datasets indicates that a limited number of serotypes, largely represented in PCV-7, accounted for the majority of episodes of pneumococcal AOM in children between 6 and 59 months of age. Certain serotypes appeared to be relatively more significant in children {\textless}6 months or {\textgreater}59 months of age.},

abstract = {Background/Purpose(s): In Taiwan, clinical and microbiological data on acute otitis media (AOM) with spontaneous otorrhea in children are limited. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on children with AOM and spontaneous otorrhea between January 2011 and June 2012. Otorrhea samples were collected using sterile swabs and sent for cultures. Pathogens found were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Pneumococcal isolates collected from October 2011 to June 2012 were serotyped. Results: A total of 92 patients were enrolled in the study for demographic and microbiological analysis. Their median age was 2.5 years. After excluding those with lobar pneumonia, 84 patients were included for analysis of clinical manifestation. The mean febrile duration was 6 days. Leukocytosis and C-reactive protein (CRP) level {\textgreater}50mg/L were noted in 29 (34.5{\%}) patients and 38 (45.2{\%}) patients, respectively. Patients with pneumococcal infection were older (p=0.007) and had more severe symptoms [fever (p=0.001), otalgia (p=0.055), respiratory symptoms (p=0.002-0.03), and higher CRP level (p=0.015)] than children with other bacterial infection. Otorrhea cultures were obtained from 69 (75{\%}) patients, of whom 52 had definitive AOM pathogens. The most common causative pathogen was S. pneumoniae (61.5{\%}), followed by S. aureus (36.5{\%}). Serotype 19A accounted for two-thirds of pneumococcal isolates and had a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (66.7{\%}) and ceftriaxone (83.3{\%}). Conclusion: S. pneumoniae was found to be the most important source of AOM with spontaneous otorrhea in children and caused more severe symptoms. Serotype 19A, which was usually nonsusceptible to antimicrobial agents, was the most prevalent serotype in these patients. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The goal of this research was to determine the cost-effectiveness of ciprofloxacin 0.3{\%}/dexamethasone 0.1{\%} (CD) otic suspension versus ofloxacin 0.3{\%} otic solution (OFX) for treatment of acute otitis media in tympanostomy tube patients. METHODS A decision-analytic model was used to emulate the ototopical treatment of acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes. The economic outcome was the cost per otorrhea-free day (OFD) achieved per episode of care. Three tiers of antimicrobial therapy were modeled, with each successive tier representing the retreatment of clinical failures from the preceding tier. First-tier therapy compared CD and OFX using outcome measures obtained from a randomized clinical trial (n = 599). Second-tier therapy modeled the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate (ACA) using outcome measures obtained from a physician survey and medical literature. Third-tier therapy was modeled as pathogen-specific and curative. It could follow one of three pathways: 1) intramuscular ceftriaxone; 2) oral fluconazole; or 3) hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. Third-tier outcomes were based on a physician survey. Cost data were obtained from standard references and presented from a payer perspective. RESULTS The expected therapeutic costs were 249.40 dollars for the CD pathway and 265.44 dollars for the OFX pathway. The estimated number of OFDs per episode of care was 25.88 for the CD pathway and 23.86 for the OFX pathway. The cost-effectiveness ratios for CD and OFX therapies were 9.64 dollars and 11.13 dollars per OFD, respectively. CONCLUSION CD is both more effective and less costly than OFX for the treatment of acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study investigated: (i) changes in the incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) following introduction of public funding for free inoculation with 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13, respectively) and (ii) changes in the rate of myringotomies for AOM (MyfA) in children 1year following the publication of the first edition of the clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AOM in children in Japan. METHODS PCV7 was launched on the Japanese market in 2010 and gained public funding in 2011. PCV7 was replaced with PCV13 in November 2013. Using the Japan Medical Data Center Claims Database, an 11-year study conducted between January 2005 and December 2015 investigated the decline in the incidence of visits to medical institutions (VtMI) due to all-cause AOM in children {\textless}15years. The rate of MyfA from January 2007 to December 2015was also investigated and changes before and after introduction of public funding for PCV7 (pfPCV7) and PCV13 (pfPCV13) for children were examined. Statistical data for the age group between 10 years and {\textless}15years served as the control. An analysis was conducted to examine changes for each age group, from infants that had received PCVs to children {\textless}5years. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and Ryan's multiple comparison tests. Ryan's multiple comparison tests were applied at a 5{\%} level of significance. Due to significant changes in the guidelines on the indications for myringotomy introduced in 2013, statistical analysis of the rate of MyfA was limited to the pre- and post-PCV7 period. RESULTS After introduction of pfPCV7 and pfPCV13, no significant suppression of the incidence of VtMI was observed in any age group. There was a gradual decline in the rate of MyfA after 2011. Compared to the control group, significant differences in all age groups from infants to children {\textless}5years were observed (p{\textless}0.009, chi-square test). Within 2 years after the introduction of PCV7, a significant decline in the rate of MyfA was observed in 1- and 5-year-olds using Ryan's multiple comparison tests at a 5{\%} level of significance. CONCLUSION The preventative effect of PCVs on AOM was not established in this study. There was, however, a significant decline in the rate of MyfA among 1- and 5-year-olds. Taking into consideration past studies, PCV7 may play a role in preventing the aggravation of AOM in 1-year-olds. When evaluating the effectiveness of PCVs, measures to evaluate severity may be as important as evaluating disease prevention.},

abstract = {This work is the first attempt to quantify the overall effects of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) vaccination programme in the Dutch population taking into account all the direct and indirect effects of the vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease. Using available Dutch data, a dynamic transmission model for the spread of pneumococci and potential subsequent invasive pneumococcal disease has been adapted to the Dutch setting. Overall, invasive pneumococcal disease cases in the Netherlands are predicted to decrease from a pre-vaccination level of 2623 cases annually to 2475, 2289, 2185, 2179, and 2178 cases annually 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-years, respectively, post-vaccination. Therefore, vaccination with PCV13 in the Netherlands is predicted to lower invasive pneumococcal disease cases per year by up to 445 cases in the medium- to long-term. The results are quite robust for the sensitivity analyses performed on the parameters that regulate herd immunity and competition between vaccine and non-vaccine types.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Acute otitis media (AOM) not only affects childhood quality of life (QoL), but can also affect parental QoL. We adapted a previously published questionnaire on the effect of childhood recurrent ear, nose and throat infections on parental QoL for use with AOM and used it in an observational, multicentre, prospective study of children with AOM. METHODS The AOM-specific parental QoL questionnaire grouped 15 items into emotional, daily disturbance, total and overall parental QoL impact scores. The questionnaire was assessed using item-convergent and item-discriminant validity criteria and internal consistency reliability; and then used with parents of children aged {\textless}6 years diagnosed with AOM at 73 practices in Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Bivariate analyses explored the differences in mean parental QoL impact scores by various characteristics. RESULTS The questionnaire demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency reliability for the various components (Cronbach's $\alpha$ 0.82-0.97). There were 1419 AOM episodes among 5882 healthy children over 1 year, of which 1063 episodes (74.9{\%}) among 852 children had a questionnaire. Parents reported interrupted sleep (68.4{\%}), worry (51.0{\%}), altered daily schedule (44.6{\%}) and less leisure time (41.5{\%}) with a score ≥ 3 (1 = least to 5 = most impact). Factors that adversely affected parental QoL included: increased parental perception of AOM severity, younger child age and multiple AOM episodes. CONCLUSIONS The AOM-specific parental QoL questionnaire demonstrated good performance across five European countries. Parental QoL was affected by childhood AOM proportionally to severity, number of episodes and younger child age.},

abstract = {Over 90 capsular serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common nasopharyngeal colonizer and major cause of pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis, are known. It is unclear why some serotypes can persist at all: They are more easily cleared from carriage and compete poorly in vivo. Serotype-specific immune responses, which could promote diversity in principle, are weak enough to allow repeated colonizations by the same type. We show that weak serotype-specific immunity and an acquired response not specific to the capsule can together reproduce observed diversity. Serotype-specific immunity stabilizes competition, and acquired immunity to noncapsular antigens reduces fitness differences. Our model can be used to explain the effects of pneumococcal vaccination and indicates general factors that regulate the diversity of pathogens.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of the Wyeth heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against clinical and radiograph-confirmed pneumonia in children. METHODS: The heptavalent CRM(197) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 15 months of age in a randomized, double blind trial. Children were randomized to receive either the CRM(197) PCV (vaccine group) or the meningococcal type C CRM(197) conjugate vaccine (control group). The primary outcome of this trial was invasive pneumococcal disease. In addition children with the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia in the study population were identified through review of automated inpatient, emergency and outpatient databases. The subset of the cohort of these children who had chest radiographs obtained at the time of diagnosis was identified, and the original reading of their radiographs by the radiologist was obtained from automated databases. Rates of clinically diagnosed pneumonia, of pneumonia with a radiograph obtained regardless of result, of pneumonia with positive radiograph (consolidation, empyema or parenchymal infiltrate) and of pneumonia with only perihilar infiltrates were compared between vaccinated and nonvaccinated groups. In addition risk of disease pneumonia was evaluated by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: The incidence of a first pneumonia episode in the control group was 55.9 per 1000 person-years. A radiograph was obtained in 61{\%} of episodes, a positive radiograph in 21{\%} and perihilar findings in an additional 5{\%}. In per protocol follow-up of children given PCV, first episodes of all clinically diagnosed pneumonia were reduced by 4.3{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), -3.5, 11.5{\%}, = 0.27], episodes with a radiograph were reduced by 9.8{\%} (CI 0.1, 18.5{\%}, {\textless} 0.05) and episodes with a positive radiograph were reduced by 20.5{\%} (CI 4.4, 34.0, = 0.02). In the intent to treat analysis including all episodes after randomization, episodes with a positive radiograph were reduced by 17.7{\%}, =.01). The greatest impact was in the first year of life with a 32.2{\%} reduction and a 23.4{\%} reduction in the first 2 years, but only a 9.1{\%} reduction in children {\textgreater}2 years of age. Asians, blacks and Hispanics were at higher risk of pneumonia than were whites, but there was no evidence of ethnic variation in PCV effectiveness. Ten of the 11 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia with a positive blood culture were in the control group. CONCLUSION: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine tested was effective in reducing the risk of pneumonia in young children.},

There are promising signs of improved diagnostic yields for pneumococcal pneumonia when using molecular techniques to detect pneumococcal gene sequences in blood or by combining serum biomarkers with rapid pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. Pathogens have traditionally been difficult to detect in pneumonia and treatment is usually successful with empiric antibiotics. However, directed antibiotic treatment has significant benefits in terms of antibiotic stewardship and these new technologies make this goal a possibility, though not yet a reality.},

abstract = {Invasive pneumococcal disease in older children and adults declined markedly after introduction in 2000 of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for young children. An empirical quantitative model was developed to estimate the herd (indirect) effects on the incidence of invasive disease among persons {\textgreater}or=5 years of age induced by vaccination of young children with 1, 2, or {\textgreater}or=3 doses of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar (PCV7), containing serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. From 1994 to 2003, cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were prospectively identified in Georgia Health District-3 (eight metropolitan Atlanta counties) by Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs). From 2000 to 2003, vaccine coverage levels of PCV7 for children aged 19-35 months in Fulton and DeKalb counties (of Atlanta) were estimated from the National Immunization Survey (NIS). Based on incidence data and the estimated average number of doses received by 15 months of age, a Poisson regression model was fit, describing the trend in invasive pneumococcal disease in groups not targeted for vaccination (i.e., adults and older children) before and after the introduction of PCV7. Highly significant declines in all the serotypes contained in PCV7 in all unvaccinated populations (5-19, 20-39, 40-64, and {\textgreater}64 years) from 2000 to 2003 were found under the model. No significant change in incidence was seen from 1994 to 1999, indicating rates were stable prior to vaccine introduction. Among unvaccinated persons 5+ years of age, the modeled incidence of disease caused by PCV7 serotypes as a group dropped 38.4{\%}, 62.0{\%}, and 76.6{\%} for 1, 2, and 3 doses, respectively, received on average by the population of children by the time they are 15 months of age. Incidence of serotypes 14 and 23F had consistent significant declines in all unvaccinated age groups. In contrast, the herd immunity effects on vaccine-related serotype 6A incidence were inconsistent. Increasing trends of non-vaccine serotypes, in particular 19A, were noted in most unvaccinated age groups, but these increases were substantially smaller than the concurrent decreases among the vaccine serotypes. Also, the model estimated PCV7 to have a greater (p=0.014) indirect impact on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by all vaccine serotypes among African-Americans of all ages than for whites. Thus, conjugate vaccines may be able to induce herd effects even in situations where vaccine coverage is far from complete or with schedules using fewer than 3 or 4 doses. Because the model was based on incidence rates and PCV7 coverage in Atlanta, our findings should be validated in other geographic areas.},

abstract = {By use of multilocus sequence typing, Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates causing invasive disease (n=150) were compared with those from nasopharyngeal carriage (n=351) among children in Oxford. The prevalence of individual clones (sequence types) and serotypes among isolates from invasive disease was related to their prevalence in carriage, and an odds ratio (OR) for invasive disease was calculated for the major clones and serotypes. All major carried clones and serotypes caused invasive disease, although their ability to do so varied greatly. Thus, 2 serotype 14 clones were approximately 10-fold overrepresented among disease isolates, compared with carriage isolates, whereas a serotype 3 clone was approximately 10-fold underrepresented. The lack of heterogeneity between the ORs of different clones of the same serotype, and analysis of isolates of the same genotype, but different serotype, suggested that capsular serotype may be more important than genotype in the ability of pneumococci to cause invasive disease.},

abstract = {Background: Early onset of persistent otitis media is a priority issue for Australian Indigenous populations. The objective is to determine the direct and short-term impact of one, two and three doses of any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) formulation on nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), the otopathogens targeted by current PCVs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) to 29 September 2015. We also scanned reference lists of recent reviews and contacted authors. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a PCV schedule commencing ≤3 months of age that reported controlled non-cumulative group-specific prevalence data for carriage of Spn or NTHi at age {\textless} 12 months. We performed a standard risk of bias assessment. We estimated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%}CI) for each vaccine dose on NP carriage by meta-analysis. Results: We included 16 RCTs involving 14,776 participants. The PCVs were conjugated to diphtheria toxin CRM197, diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid or NTHi protein D and varied in valency (4-13). Controls were non-PCVs, placebo or no vaccine. The earliest carriage outcome was from 2 to 9 months of age. Compared to controls, there were no significant differences between one or two doses of PCV on vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal carriage at {\~{}}4 and {\~{}}6 months respectively. However, VT carriage was significantly lower at {\~{}}7 months RR 0.67 95{\%}CI 0.56-0.81 from 9 studies and 7613 infants and non-vaccine type (NVT) carriage was higher RR 1.23 95{\%}CI 1.09-1.40 from 8 studies and 5861 infants. No impact on overall pneumococcal or NTHi carriage was found. Conclusions: The primary PCV schedule had no significant short-term impact on overall pneumococcal or NTHi NP carriage and a limited impact on VT pneumococcal carriage before the third dose.},

abstract = {Defining the propensity of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) serotypes to invade sterile body sites following nasopharyngeal (NP) acquisition has the potential to inform about how much invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) may occur in a typical population with a given distribution of carriage serotypes. Data from enhanced surveillance for IPD in Massachusetts children ≤7 years in 2003/04, 2006/07 and 2008/09 seasons and surveillance of SP NP carriage during the corresponding respiratory seasons in 16 Massachusetts communities in 2003/04 and 8 of the 16 communities in both 2006/07 and 2008/09 were used to compute a serotype specific "invasive capacity (IC)" by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children of the same age. A total of 206 IPD and 806 NP isolates of SP were collected during the study period. An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimates between the serotypes having the highest (18C, 33F, 7F, 19A, 3 and 22F) and lowest (6C, 23A, 35F, 11A, 35B, 19F, 15A, and 15BC) IC was observed. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes currently colonizing children in Massachusetts were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes. Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and as new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are introduced, ongoing surveillance will be essential to monitor whether serotypes with high invasive capacity emerge (e.g. 33F, 22F) as successful colonizers resulting in increased IPD incidence due to replacement serotypes.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is a respiratory disease commonly caused by viral infections. Physicians regularly prescribe antibiotics despite bacterial etiologies being uncommon. This is of concern, as this use adds to the selection pressure for resistance. Here we present the descriptive epidemiology of acute rhinosinusitis and corresponding antibiotic prescribing practices by Canadian outpatient physicians from 2007-2013. MATERIALS/METHODS Diagnosis and antibiotic prescription data for ARS were extracted from the Canadian Disease and Therapeutic Index for 2007 to 2013, and population data were acquired from Statistics Canada. ARS diagnosis and antibiotic prescription rates and frequencies of antibiotic classes were calculated. RESULTS Eighty-eight percent of patients diagnosed with ARS in 2013 were adults, with a greater rate of antibiotic prescriptions observed among the adults relative to the pediatric patients (1632.9 and 468.6 antibiotic prescriptions per 10,000 inhabitants). Between 2007 and 2013, the ARS diagnosis rate decreased from 596 to 464 diagnoses per 10,000 inhabitants, while the percentage of diagnoses with antibiotic prescriptions at the national level remained stable (87{\%} to 84{\%}). From 2007 to 2013, prescription rates for macrolides decreased from 203.5 to 105.4 prescriptions per 10,000 inhabitants. In 2013, penicillins with extended spectrum were more commonly prescribed compared to macrolides among adult patients (153.5 and 105.4 prescriptions per 10,000 inhabitants, respectively). CONCLUSION This study is the first to describe physician antibiotic prescribing practices for treatment of ARS in Canada. Results show that antibiotic treatment for ARS represents an area for implementing antimicrobial stewardship, and through it, managing antibiotic resistance. Further work is required to better understand diagnosing practices and treatment criteria for ARS, and use this information to further assist physicians to limit unnecessary antibiotic prescribing practices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood infection, which is usually managed in the outpatient setting. Yet, the more severe cases are referred for inpatient treatment. We hypothesized that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), administered during the first year of life, would decrease AOM admissions rate in this age group. We studied the characteristics of infants admitted with AOM and acute mastoiditis (AM) in the PCV13 era, routinely given from November 2010 to all infants. METHODS Charts of infants ≤1 year that were hospitalized during 1/1/2010–31/12/2015 with AOM, with or without AM, were retrieved using hospitalization codes. We compared 2010–11 (transition years, from PCV7 to PCV13) to 2012–15 (post-PCV13 marketing years). RESULTS AOM was the primary/secondary discharge diagnosis in ∼4{\%} of all admitted infants ≤1 year. Boys had more admissions than girls (62{\%} vs 38{\%}). Accuracy of AOM diagnoses substantially increased in the post-marketing years. The average hospitalization duration slightly shortened, from 3.21 (2010–11) to 2.99 days (2012–15) (p = 0.52). Despite considerably modest pre-admission antibiotic treatment rate ({\textless}30{\%}), AM was infrequent (∼3.4{\%} of AOM admissions). Amoxicillin was the most common antibiotic therapy given before admission and during hospitalization. The number of myringotomies, usually reserved for treatment failure cases, significantly declined, and there were almost no cases of resistant bacteria. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in ∼20{\%} of collected respiratory samples, and influenza A/B viruses in ∼8{\%}.

We found a great diversity in assumptions (eg, vaccine efficacy parameters, incidence rates for both invasive and non-invasive disease) mainly due to local variation in data and opinions. Accordingly, the results varied greatly, from total net savings to over euro 100,000 per discounted QALY gained. The cost of the vaccination program (determined by price per dose and schedule (4 or 3 doses, or fewer)), and likely herd immunity impacts are highly influential though rarely explored in these published studies. If the net long-term impact (determined by a mixture of effects related to herd immunity, serotype replacement, antibiotic resistance and cross reactivity) remains beneficial and if a 3-dose schedule confers near-equivalent protection to a 4-dose schedule, the cost-effectiveness of PCV7 vaccination programs can be viewed as attractive in developed countries.},

abstract = {Background: The 10-valent protein D pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (P. HiD-CV) was licensed on the basis of immunogenicity studies and there are no published data on its effectiveness to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). In the province of Quebec, Canada, P. HiD-CV was introduced in the summer of 2009, replacing the 7-valent CRM197 vaccine (PCV-7). Transition to the new vaccine was recommended regardless of the number of PCV7 doses already administered. Methods: IPD rates in children born in 2007-2010 and observed up to the end of 2010 were computed from laboratory surveillance data. The main vaccine used for the infant primary immunization series (mainly 2 doses at 2-4 months) and the toddler (12 months) booster dose was inferred from the Quebec City Immunization Registry data. Results: IPD rates were significantly lower in the cohorts exposed to P. HiD-CV (35/100,000 person-years) as compared with those exposed to PCV-7 (64/100,000. person-years; p=0.03). There was no breakthrough vaccine-type IPD case among children who had received ???2 P. HiD-CV doses for the primary series or a single P. HiD-CV dose as a booster. There was also a statistically non-significant lower frequency of 19A and other non-vaccine types IPD cases in children exposed to 2+1 P. HiD-CV doses as compared with those exposed to PCV-7. Interpretation: Results are compatible with a high level of protection induced by P. HiD-CV against IPD caused by homologous serotypes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to simulate human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in a heterosexual population and subsequently analyze the incremental costs and effects of introducing a vaccination program against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Denmark compared with screening alone.

METHODS: The analysis was performed in two phases. First, an agent-based transmission model was developed that described the HPV transmission without and with HPV vaccination. Second, an analysis of the incremental costs and effects was performed. The results of prevalence estimates of HPV, genital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1-3), and cervical cancer in the model simulations before and after introduction of HPV vaccination were extrapolated to the Danish population figures. Incremental costs and effects were then estimated. Future costs and effects were discounted.

RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness ratios for annual vaccination of 12-year-old girls, with a vaccination rate of 70 percent without a catch-up program, were estimated at approximately 1,917 euro per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY, 3 percent discount rate) and 10,846 euro/QALY (5 percent discount rate), given a 62-year time horizon.

CONCLUSIONS: A vaccination program would incur extra vaccination costs but would save treatment costs and improve both quality of life and survival.},

Clinicians and microbiologists have struggled to develop tests that can identify pneumococcal respiratory infection and accurately distinguish colonization from invasive disease. Molecular methods hold the promise of an improved ability to rapidly detect microorganisms in respiratory secretions and to make an accurate diagnosis; however, interpretation of diagnostic testing for S. pneumoniae remains problematic. Molecular assays, such as those targeting the pneumolysin gene, may cross-react with other streptococcal species, confounding detection and quantification. Assays that target the autolysin gene appear to be more specific. Even when accurately identified, however, the significance of S. pneumoniae DNA detected in clinical samples is difficult to determine. Here we will discuss the challenges faced in the interpretation of molecular testing for S. pneumoniae, and some strategies that might be used to improve our ability to diagnose pneumococcal respiratory infection.},

abstract = {Introduction: Dynamics of pneumococcal disease incidence and serotype distribution prior to introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) will assist in understanding effects of the vaccine over time and will be important in choosing the optimal PCV formulation. Methods: We conducted active, laboratory-based, national surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) through the Group for Enteric, Respiratory and Meningeal Disease Surveillance in South Africa (GERMS-SA) from 2003 through 2008. Over 130 laboratories report to this system. Pneumococci were serotyped using Quellung and isolates screened for resistance by disk diffusion; minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined on potentially resistant isolates. We used univariate and multivariable multinomial regression models to assess differences between serotypes. Results: GERMS-SA identified 8674 cases among children {\textless}5 years. Overall, 58{\%} (3849/6668), 65{\%} (4314/6668), and 85{\%} (5669/6668) of cases and 61{\%} (455/751), 64{\%} (482/751), 82{\%} (616/751) of deaths were due to serotypes included in 7-valent PCV, 10-valent PCV and 13-valent PCV, respectively. Serotypes 6A and 19A accounted for 16{\%} (527/3252) of penicillin non-susceptible disease. In 2008, reported incidence of IPD was 6-fold higher in children {\textless}1 compared to children 1-4 years of age: 87 per 100,000 population and 14/100,000, respectively. The relative risk of IPD was 21-fold (95{\%} CI, 19-24) and 34-fold (29-41) greater in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected children in the {\textless}1 year and 1-4-year-old age groups respectively. On multivariable analysis serotypes 6B (relative risk ratio (RRR) 0.7; confidence interval (CI) 0.5-0.9), 18C (RRR 0.3; CI 0.1-0.5), 1 (RRR 0.2; CI 0.1-0.4) and 8 (RRR 0.2; CI 0.1-0.4) were significantly less common in HIV-infected individuals than serotype 14. Conclusions: All vaccine formulations have the potential to prevent most cases and deaths from IPD in children in South Africa. Vaccines with protection against 19A would be advantageous in South Africa. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The state of pneumococcal carriage-that is, pneumococcal colonization in the nasopharynx of healthy persons-represents a reservoir for the spread of pneumococci among individuals. In light of the introduction of new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, further knowledge on the dynamics of pneumococcal carriage is important. Different serotypes (strains) of pneumococcus are known to compete with each other in colonizing human hosts. Understanding the strength and mode of between-serotype competition is important because of its implications for vaccine-induced changes in the ecology of pneumococcal carriage. Competition may work through reduced acquisition of new serotypes, due to concurrent carriage in the individual, or through enhanced clearance of serotypes in carriers who harbor more than 1 serotype simultaneously. The authors employed longitudinal data (1999-2001) on pneumococcal carriage in Danish day-care children to analyze between-serotype competition. The data included observations of carriage in children who had not been vaccinated against pneumococcus, and the level of pneumococcal antibiotic resistance and antibiotic usage in the community was very low. Clearance of any single serotype was not affected by simultaneous carriage of other serotypes. In contrast, acquisition of other serotypes in already-colonized hosts was weak (relative rate of acquisition = 0.09, 95{\%} credible interval: 0.05, 0.15).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To assess quality of outpatient antibiotic use in Europe in 2009 based on the 12 European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) drug-specific quality indicators and to evaluate changes in quality between 2004 and 2009. METHODS Quality of outpatient antibiotic use in 2009 was compared between 32 countries by calculating the indicator values for 2009 for each of the 12 ESAC drug-specific quality indicators based on outpatient antibiotic use data expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID). For each of the indicators we grouped the 2009 indicator values into four quartiles. To evaluate changes in quality between 2004 and 2009, based on their respective indicator values, countries were also grouped according to the quartile distribution of the 2004 indicator values. Only countries able to deliver data for both years were included in this analysis. RESULTS In 2009 a difference in the quality of outpatient antibiotic use between Nordic and Southern European countries was observed. Quality of outpatient antibiotic use decreased between 2004 and 2009. In particular, there were increases in the quality indicators [J01F{\_}DID], [J01M{\_}DID], [J01CR{\_}{\%}] and [J01{\_}B/N], i.e. the use of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins in DID, the use of quinolones in DID, the proportional use of combinations of penicillins, including $\beta$-lactamase inhibitors and the ratio of broad- to narrow-spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Quality of outpatient antibiotic use in DID decreased between 2004 and 2009. A continuous effort to improve outpatient antibiotic consumption seems to be essential to reduce outpatient antibiotic use in general and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in particular.},

DESIGN Prospective cohort study using questionnaires, telephone follow up, medical chart data, and costs according to Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) schedules. SETTING 16 FPOs, 12 WICs, and 13 EDs in three Ontario cities. PARTICIPANTS Consecutive patients with one of eight predefined minor acute illnesses found in all three settings (upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, acute otitis media, serous otitis media, low back pain, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infection). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES "Early" ({\textless} 3 days) versus "later" (3 days to 2 weeks) re-utilization of health services after initial encounter and direct cost to OHIP. RESULTS The overall rate of re-utilization of health services for the same episode of illness was 11.3{\%} for early and 20.6{\%} for later re-utilization. Factors associated with early re-utilization were initial evaluation in ED setting (odds ratio [OR] = 6.5, confidence interval [CI] = 2.2-19.2) and, regardless of setting, less satisfaction with patient-centred care (OR = 1.7 for each one-point decrease on a four-point scale; CI = 1.1-2.7). Factors associated with later re-utilization were ED setting (OR = 4.9; CI = 2.4-9.9) and diagnosis of urinary tract infection (OR = 2.4; CI = 1.1-5.2). Factors tested and found not signifcantly associated with rate of re-utilization were patients' age, sex, responses to a variety of questions assessing psychosocial factors (stress, social support, independence), and opinions on health care. Cost of care was similar for FPOs and WICs and higher for EDs for all diagnoses. The initial visit was the largest component of cost in all settings, and this component (as well as total cost) was consistently higher in EDs. CONCLUSION Both re-utilization rates and costs are higher for those seeking care in EDs for minor acute illness. Patient-centred care, an important feature of health care encounters regardless of setting, can reduce re-utilization rates.},

abstract = {Objectives: A wider spectrum 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in the child immunization schedule in England from 2010. We assessed the additional impact of PCV13 over PCV7 on all-cause pneumonia and empyema admissions. Methods: We extracted Hospital Episode Statistics data from 2001 to 2014 on all-cause pneumonia (ICD-10 codes J12-18) and empyema admissions (J86.0, J86.9) for children {\textless}16 years in England. Trend analysis and rate ratios (RR) were calculated comparing the Pre-vaccine era to September 2006, the PCV7 era and the PCV13 era from April 2010. Results: Annual hospital admissions for pneumonia and empyema were increasing in the Pre-vaccine era peaking in 2005 at 15,733 pneumonia and 382 empyema cases (158.6 and 3.9 per 100,000 children, respectively). These rates fell following PCV7 introduction in 2006 but began to climb soon afterwards until PCV13 was introduced. By 2013, admission rates for pneumonia and empyema were 102.2 and 1.9 per 100,000 children, respectively. We found no added benefit of PCV13 over PCV7 on pneumonia admissions following PCV13 introduction but there was a significant decrease in empyema admissions in children aged {\textless}2 years (RR 0.58; 95{\%} CI 0.34-0.99). Conclusions: Additional serotypes covered by PCV13 may be more important in the aetiology of empyema and invasive disease than as a cause of uncomplicated pneumonia.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified as a major respiratory pathogen shortly after its isolation in 1881.1 Despite a century of intensive study, and antibiotics which readily kill the organism, respiratory tract infections caused by the pneumococcus remain a formidable problem.S pneumoniae is the commonest cause of community acquired pneumonia, accounting for up to 70{\%} of cases in hospital.2 3 Pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with bacteraemia more frequently than other bacterial pneumonias4 and mortality from bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia during the first few days of hospitalisation has changed little since the pre-antibiotic era.5 6 There is also evidence, from the UK and other countries, that the number of cases of pneumococcal bacteraemia is rising.7 8 In the third world five million children under the age of five die each year from acute lower respiratory tract infections in which S pneumoniae is probably the primary agent,9 and patients with HIV infection and AIDS also have a high risk of pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteraemia.10 Furthermore, the worldwide increase in penicillin resistance among pneumococci11-15 and the limited use of the pneumococcal vaccine16 suggest that morbidity and mortality from pneumococcal disease may increase.In recent years there has been an increased understanding of the interactions between the pneumococcus and the host, both in terms of how the virulence factors of the organism contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumonia and how the host's response to infection can be harmful as well as protective. The role of cytokines in pneumococcal pneumonia, the detailed behaviour of neutrophils in the disease, and the mechanisms by which the pneumococcus attaches to the host both during nasopharyngeal colonisation and during invasive disease have all been the subject of recent investigation. Whilst antibiotics and supportive care are likely to remain the keystone of the {\ldots}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To have wide global coverage of pneumococcal serotypes, the number of serotypes covered by the current 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine must be increased. We have studied the safety and immunogenicity of an 11-valent mixed carrier vaccine (PncDT11) in infants. METHODS: The study vaccine contained polysaccharide antigens of serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 9V, 19F and 23F conjugated to tetanus protein and serotypes 3, 6B, 14 and 18C conjugated to diphtheria toxoid. The vaccine was administered to Finnish (n = 117) and Israeli (n = 135) infants at ages 2, 4, 6 and 12 months concomitantly with other vaccines used in national vaccination programs. IgG antibodies to polysaccharides were determined by enzyme immunoassay from serum samples taken at ages 2, 7, 12 and 13 months. After each injection the infants were followed for 30 min to detect any immediate adverse reactions, and parents were given a diary card to report any adverse events during the next 5 days. RESULTS: No severe adverse reactions occurred, and immediate adverse reactions were rare. After each dose approximately 30{\%} of the vaccinees experienced local reactions of which pain was the most common. Fever of {\textgreater}38 degrees C was reported in 33 to 53{\%} of the vaccinees and high fever ({\textgreater}40 degrees C) was reported 6 times. The PncDT11 vaccine was immunogenic. The antibody concentrations after primary immunization series were higher in Israeli than in Finnish infants, but the differences were not significant for most serotypes. The difference was most marked at 13 months, a time point at which the difference was significant in 10 of 11 serotypes. CONCLUSION: PncDT11 is safe and immunogenic in infants. The use of 11-valent pneumococcal vaccine would increase the serotype coverage beyond the currently available 7-valent vaccine.},

abstract = {Background: Efficacy of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was inferred before licensure from an aggregate correlate of protection established for the seven-valent vaccine (PCV7). We did a postlicensure assessment of serotype-specific vaccine effectiveness and immunogenicity in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to derive the correlates of protection for individual serotypes. Methods: We assessed vaccine effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease using the indirect cohort method. We measured serotype-specific IgG concentration in infants after they were given two priming doses of PCV7 (n=126) or PCV13 (n=237) and opsonophagocytic antibody titre from a subset of these infants (n=100). We derived correlates of protection by relating percentage protection to a threshold antibody concentration achieved by an equivalent percentage of infants. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate vaccine effectiveness and reverse cumulative distribution curves to estimate correlates of protection. Findings: For the 706 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease included in the study, PCV13 vaccine effectiveness after two doses before age 12 months or one dose from 12 months was 75{\%} (95{\%} CI 58-84). Vaccine effectiveness was 90{\%} (34-98) for the PCV7 serotypes and 73{\%} (55-84) for the six additional serotypes included in PCV13. Protection was shown for four of the six additional PCV13 serotypes (vaccine effectiveness for serotype 3 was not significant and no cases of serotype 5 infection occurred during the observation period). The vaccine effectiveness for PCV13 and PCV7 was lower than predicted by the aggregate correlate of protection of 0{\textperiodcentered}35 $\mu$g/mL used during licensing. Calculated serotype-specific correlates of protection were higher than 0{\textperiodcentered}35 $\mu$g/mL for serotypes 1, 3, 7F, 19A, 19F, and lower than 0{\textperiodcentered}35 $\mu$g/mL for serotypes 6A, 6B, 18C, and 23F. Opsonophagocytic antibody titres of 1 in 8 or higher did not predict protection. Interpretation: PCV13 provides significant protection for most of the vaccine serotypes. Although use of the aggregate correlate of protection of 0{\textperiodcentered}35 $\mu$g/mL has enabled the licensing of effective new PCVs, serotype-specific correlates of protection vary widely. The relation between IgG concentration after priming and long-term protection needs to be better understood.

abstract = {The first recorded myringotomy was in 1649. Astley Cooper presented two papers to the Royal Society in 1801, based on his observation that myringotomy could improve hearing. Widespread inappropriate use of the procedure followed, with no benefit to patients; this led to it falling from favour for many decades. Hermann Schwartze reintroduced myringotomy later in the nineteenth century. It had been realised earlier that the tympanic membrane heals spontaneously, and much experimentation took place in attempting to keep the perforation open. The first described grommet was made of gold foil. Other materials were tried, including Politzer's attempts with rubber. Armstrong's vinyl tube effectively reintroduced grommets into current practice last century. There have been many eponymous variants, but the underlying principle of creating a perforation and maintaining it with a ventilation tube has remained unchanged. Recent studies have cast doubt over the long-term benefits of grommet insertion; is this the end of the third era?},

Our objective was to follow all children born in 2006 in Sweden and to analyse antibiotic consumption during each month of life for the first two years and thereafter for every year during their third to fifth years of life. METHODS: This was a register-based, open-cohort study where we used the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, which covers the whole population, to identify the type and date of purchase of antibiotics for the children in the cohort. RESULTS: During the first one-year follow-up period, 101 555 children up to one year of age were living in Sweden, of which 50 135 were boys and 49 420 were girls. Children consumed the largest amount of antibiotics during their second year of life. In our cohort, 51{\%} received antibiotics at some point during the second year and 24{\%} received multiple treatments. The consumption then dropped with every year of life during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that actions against overprescribing of antibiotics to children should be targeted towards the second year of life in order to have the greatest effect on consumption.},

abstract = {Background Pneumococcal infection is an important and preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. The Turkish government introduced 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) into the national immunization program in 2009. This suggests that replacing 7-valent PCV with a higher-valent version could at least maintain "standard of care" if not improve it, and that it could be affordable. Objectives and Methods The aim of this analysis was to assess the potential direct cost-effectiveness of 13-valent PCV in Turkey, a country with a birth cohort of 1.4 million, against a "no vaccine" state, against the default 7-valent PCV state, and against a 10-valent PCV state, using a published cohort model with a 5-year horizon. Results and Conclusions The cost per life-year gained is below the 1 × per-capita gross domestic product threshold across large changes in key input parameters, indicating that the model is stable and suggesting that any PCV would be very cost-effective in a Turkish national pediatric immunization schedule. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

abstract = {Background: Retrospective cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccination programs using routinely collected post-implementation data are sparse by comparison with pre-program analyses. We performed a retrospective economic evaluation of the childhood 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) program in Australia. Methods: We developed a deterministic multi-compartment model that describes health states related to invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease. Costs (Australian dollars, A{\$}) and health effects (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were attached to model states. The perspective for costs was that of the healthcare system and government. Where possible, we used observed changes in the disease rates from national surveillance and healthcare databases to estimate the impact of the PCV7 program (2005-2010). We stratified our cost-effectiveness results into alternative scenarios which differed by the outcome states included. Parameter uncertainty was explored using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: The PCV7 program was estimated to have prevented {\~{}}5900 hospitalisations and {\~{}}160 deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Approximately half of these were prevented in adults via herd protection. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was {\~{}}A{\$}161,000 per QALY gained when including only IPD-related outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of PCV7 remained in the range A{\$}88,000-{\$}122,000 when changes in various non-invasive disease states were included. The inclusion of observed changes in adult non-invasive pneumonia deaths substantially improved cost-effectiveness ({\~{}}A{\$}9000 per QALY gained). Conclusion: Using the initial vaccine price negotiated for Australia, the PCV7 program was unlikely to have been cost-effective (at conventional thresholds) unless observed reductions in non-invasive pneumonia deaths in the elderly are attributed to it. Further analyses are required to explore this finding, which has significant implications for the incremental benefit achievable by adult PCV programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Otitis media (OM) morbidity in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children is historically higher than that in other US children. METHODS: Outpatient visits and hospitalizations listing OM as a diagnosis and outpatient visits listing myringotomy with insertion of tubes as a procedure among AI/AN children {\textless}5 years of age from the Indian Health Service National Patient Information Reporting system for 2003-2005 were analyzed. Outpatient visits and hospitalizations with OM for the general US child population were analyzed using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care and National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 2003-2005, and the 2003 Kids' Inpatient Database, respectively. RESULTS: The OM-associated outpatient visit rate for AI/AN children {\textless}5 years of age (89 per 100 children/yr) for 2003-2005 was less than that reported for 1994-1996 (138); however, the rate increased for Alaska region (158 to 181). The OM outpatient visit and myringotomy with insertion of tubes rates (181 and 2.6 per 100 children/yr, respectively) for AI/AN children in Alaska were higher than rates for children in each of the other IHS regions and rates for US children (63 and 1.8 per 100 children/yr, respectively). The OM outpatient visit rates for AI/AN infants (184), especially in the Alaska region (334), were higher than the rate for US infants (84). CONCLUSIONS: The OM-associated outpatient visit rate in AI/AN children {\textless}5 years of age has decreased but remains higher than that of the US general child population; however, the rate increased in the Alaska region, where a limited decline in invasive pneumococcal disease has been demonstrated. The ongoing disparity in OM outpatient visit rates among AI/AN children, especially Alaska Native children, indicates a need for new prevention measures, including expanded-valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, to reduce OM morbidity.},

Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) has been proposed as a component in human vaccines against S. pneumoniae to provide greater breadth of coverage than can be obtained with the 7-valent conjugate vaccine. The cross-reactivity of PspA is associated with the 'PspA family' structure. In this study we examined strains of S. pneumoniae from patients with and without SCD to determine whether the strains infecting the hypersusceptible population of SCD patients were limited to the same two PspA families already known to comprise over 95{\%} of strains infecting non-SCD patients. Each strain was also evaluated according to the presence or absence of specific PCR fragments based on repetitive BOX elements to screen for possible SCD-associated clonal structure. Strains from SCD and non-SCD patients were similarly dispersed among the most common BOX PCR groups and strains from both groups expressed a similar distribution of PspA variants. Thus, a PspA vaccine designed for the population at large should also be appropriate for patients with SCD.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pneumococcal pneumonia (PP) has a high burden of morbimortality in children. Use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) is an effective preventive measure. After PCV 7-valent (PCV7) withdrawal, PCV 10-valent (PCV10) and PCV 13-valent (PCV13) are the alternatives in Peru. This study aimed to evaluate cost effectiveness of these vaccines in preventing PP in Peruvian children {\textless}5 years-old.

METHODOLOGY: A cost-effectiveness analysis was developed in three phases: a systematic evidence search for calculating effectiveness; a cost analysis for vaccine strategies and outcome management; and an economic model based on decision tree analysis, including deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using acceptability curves, tornado diagram, and Monte Carlo simulation. A hypothetic 100 vaccinated children/vaccine cohort was built. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated.

RESULTS: The isolation probability for all serotypes in each vaccine was estimated: 38{\%} for PCV7, 41{\%} PCV10, and 17{\%} PCV13. Avoided hospitalization was found to be the best effectiveness model measure. Estimated costs for PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 cohorts were USD13,761, 11,895, and 12,499, respectively. Costs per avoided hospitalization were USD718 for PCV7, USD333 for PCV10, andUSD 162 for PCV13. At ICER, PCV7 was dominated by the other PCVs. Eliminating PCV7, PCV13 was more cost effective than PCV10 (confirmed in sensitivity analysis).

CONCLUSIONS: PCV10 and PCV13 are more cost effective than PCV7 in prevention of pneumonia in children {\textless}5 years-old in Peru. PCV13 prevents more hospitalizations and is more cost-effective than PCV10. These results should be considered when making decisions about the Peruvian National Inmunizations Schedule.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine the proportion of bacteremic pneumococcal cases in a group of pediatric subjects with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the importance of the different serotypes and the impact of the currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs).

METHODS: The study involved children who were ≤5 years with radiographically confirmed CAP admitted to hospital in Italy between September 2008 and March 2011. A diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed bacteremic pneumococcal CAP was made in the presence of a culture and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae.

RESULTS: A total of 510 children were included in the study. Pneumococcal CAP was diagnosed in 73 cases (14.3{\%}): S. pneumoniae was identified by means of positive real-time PCR in 67 cases (91.8{\%}), a positive blood culture in 1 (1.4{\%}) and both in 5 (6.8{\%}). Complicated pneumonia was observed significantly more often in the pneumococcal-positive cases (P=0.02) and empyema was the main complication (P=0.007). Serotype 19A was most frequently encountered (17 cases; 25.8{\%}), followed by serotypes 14 (10 cases, 15.1{\%}), 4 (5 cases, 7.6{\%}) and 3 (4 cases, 6.1{\%}). The theoretical coverage offered by the available PCVs was calculated to be 31{\%} for PCV7, 37{\%} for PCV10 and 71{\%} for PCV13.

CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, bacteremic pneumococcal CAP accounts for a significant number of CAP cases in children who were ≤5 years, with serotypes 19A and 14 being the most frequent. This suggests that PCV13 is the best means of preventing pneumococcal CAP.},

abstract = {Objective: To study the incidence rates of middle ear ventilation tube insertion in children aged 0 to 15 years in Denmark from 1997 to 2010. Methods: Using two national registers, the Danish National Health Service Register and the Danish National Patient Register, practically all cases of middle ear ventilation tube insertion performed in Denmark in the period were identified. A possible change in incidence rate over time was examined using Poisson regression analysis, while the cumulative incidence proportion was estimated using life-tables. Results: A total of 502,569 uni- or bilateral ventilation tube insertions distributed among 269,459 different children were identified. From 1997 to 2010 the age standardized incidence rate in 0-15-year-olds increased from 26 to 40 per 1000 person years with an estimated annual increase of 2.0{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 1.9-2.1{\%}). The largest increase in incidence rate was found in 1-year-olds with an annual increase of 4.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 4.4-4.6{\%}). Age-specific incidence rates remained at maximum around the age of 14 months throughout the period. The cumulative incidence proportion for the 2010 birth cohort by the time they reach the age of 5 years was estimated to 29{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 28-29{\%}). Conclusion: The rate for middle ear ventilation tube insertion in Denmark was high compared to other developed countries, and an estimated 3 in 10 children born in 2010 will undergo at least one ventilation tube insertion before their fifth birthday. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Data are presented by characteristics of patients, region of the country, and procedure categories for ambulatory and inpatient procedures separately and combined. METHODS Estimates in this report are based on data collected from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) and the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery-(NSAS). NHDS provides data on hospital inpatient care, and NSAS provides data on ambulatory surgery in hospitals and in freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. For NHDS, data were collected for approximately 282,000 discharges from 480 non-Federal short-stay hospitals (95 percent response rate). For NSAS, data were collected for approximately 125,000 ambulatory surgery discharges from 488 hospitals and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (81 percent response rate). RESULTS An estimated 71.9 million procedures were performed on 39.9 million discharges from hospitals and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers during 1996: 40.4 million procedures were for inpatients, and 31.5 million were for ambulatory patients. Females had more procedures than males, and the rate of procedures increased with age in ambulatory and inpatient settings. The leading procedures for ambulatory surgery patients and inpatients combined were arteriography and angiocardiography, endoscopy of small intestine, endoscopy of large intestine, and extraction of lens.},

Vaccination with PHiD-CV did not significantly alter the species composition, abundance, or prevalence of known pathogens. Distinct microbiomes were identified based on the abundances of Streptococcus, Moraxella, and Haemophilus species. These microbiomes shifted in composition over the study period and were independent of age, sex, school attendance, antibiotic exposure, and vaccination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of children with two doses of PHiD-CV did not significantly alter the nasopharyngeal microbiome.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding system presents challenges for using administrative data. Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop ICD-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms. METHODS: ICD-10 coding algorithms were developed by "translation" of the ICD-9-CM codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physicians' assessment of the face-validity of selected ICD-10 codes. The process of carefully developing ICD-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original ICD-9-CM algorithms, the enhanced ICD-9-CM algorithms, and the new ICD-10 coding algorithms. RESULTS: Among 56,585 patients in the ICD-9-CM data and 58,805 patients in the ICD-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new ICD-10 and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.860 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.870 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: These newly developed ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM comorbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing ICD-9-CM coding algorithms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main cause of invasive bacterial disease in children aged younger than 2 years. Navajo and White Mountain Apache children have some of the highest rates of invasive pneumococcal disease documented in the world. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a seven-valent polysaccharide protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PnCRM7) against such disease. METHODS: In a group-randomised study, we gave this vaccine to children younger than 2 years from the Navajo and White Mountain Apache Indian reservations; meningococcal type C conjugate vaccine (MnCC) served as the control vaccine. Vaccine schedules were determined by age at enrollment. We recorded episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease and serotyped isolates. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol. FINDINGS: 8292 children enrolled in the trial. In the per protocol analysis of the primary efficacy group (children enrolled by 7 months of age) there were eight cases of vaccine serotype disease in the controls and two in the PnCRM7 group; in the intention-to-treat analysis we noted 11 cases of vaccine serotype disease in the MnCC control group and two in the PnCRM7 group. After group randomisation had been controlled for, the per protocol primary efficacy of PnCRM7 was 76.8{\%} (95{\%} CI -9.4{\%} to 95.1{\%}) and the intention-to-treat total primary efficacy was 82.6{\%} (21.4{\%} to 96.1{\%}). INTERPRETATION: PnCRM7 vaccine prevents vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease even in a high risk population. Other regions with similar disease burden should consider including this vaccine in the routine childhood vaccine schedule.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess age-specific incidences of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and diagnosed serologically in a child population. The study was population-based, and prospective, and performed in primary health care settings. During a surveillance period of 12 months from 1981-1982, all pneumonia cases in a defined child population (57{\%} urban residents) were registered prospectively. In total, 201 CAP cases were diagnosed (mean age 5.6 years; 57{\%} boys; 58{\%} urban residents). S. pneumoniae etiology was studied by antibody and immune complex (IC) assays to C-polysacchride (C-PS), type-specific capsular polysaccharides (CPS), and to pneumolysin (Ply), in acute and convalescent sera. Serologic evidence of S. pneumoniae etiology was indicated in 57(28{\%}) cases, 35(61{\%}) being mixed infections with other microbes. The distribution of pneumococcal cases was 44{\%}, 30{\%} and 26{\%} in the three 5-year age groups, respectively. There were 33 (58{\%}) males and 34 (60{\%}) urban residents. In total, 26 cases were identified by antibody assays and 35 cases by IC assays, 26/35 being positive in acute sera. Responses to C-PS, CPS and Ply, when antibody and IC results are combined, were found equally often in 23-25 cases. The total annual incidence of pediatric S. pneumoniae CAP was 6.4/1000/year. S. pneumoniae etiology was found in 28{\%} of the children and was similar at all ages. The incidence of pneumococcal CAP was assessed for the first time, being high (19/1000/year) in 0- to 4-year-old urban boys and rather stable (5-9/1000/year) in all other groups by age, sex and residence.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate an intervention to reduce inappropriate use of key antibiotics with interrupted time series analysis.Methods: The intervention is a policy for appropriate use of Alert Antibiotics (carbapenems, glycopeptides, amphotericin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, piperacillin–tazobactam and third-generation cephalosporins) implemented through concurrent, patient-specific feedback by clinical pharmacists. Statistical significance and effect size were calculated by segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series of drug use and cost for 2 years before and after the intervention started.Results: Use of Alert Antibiotics increased before the intervention started but decreased steadily for 2 years thereafter. The changes in slope of the time series were 0.27 defined daily doses/100 bed-days per month (95{\%} CI 0.19–0.34) and {\pounds}1908 per month (95{\%} CI {\pounds}1238–{\pounds}2578). The cost of development, dissemination and implementation of the intervention ({\pounds}20 133) was well below the most conservative estimate of the reduction in cost ({\pounds}133 296), which is the lower 95{\%} CI of effect size assuming that cost would not have continued to increase without the intervention. However, if use had continued to increase, the difference between predicted and actual cost of Alert Antibiotics was {\pounds}572 448 (95{\%} CI {\pounds}435 696–{\pounds}709 176) over the 24 months after the intervention started.Conclusions: Segmented regression analysis of pharmacy stock data is a simple, practical and robust method for measuring the impact of interventions to change prescribing. The Alert Antibiotic Monitoring intervention was associated with significant decreases in total use and cost in the 2 years after the programme was implemented. In our hospital, the value of the data far exceeded the cost of processing and analysis.},

abstract = {AIM To estimate the overall long-term health related quality of life implications of an episode of pneumococcal meningitis in childhood. METHOD Cases were identified through two regional UK surveillance studies and traced via their general practitioners (GPs) or local hospital paediatrician. Siblings were used as controls where available. Health related quality of life was assessed using the health utilities index (HUI). Mean utility scores were compared between cases and controls and univariate linear regression was used to identify factors that influenced the overall utility scores. RESULTS HUI data were available for 71 cases and 66 controls. The mean overall utility score for cases 0.774 (95{\%} CI 0.711- 0.837) was significantly lower than for controls 0.866 (95{\%} CI 0.824-0.907) (p-value = 0.0185). Hearing was the most significantly affected health attribute (p-value {\textless} 0.006). In cases, males had lower quality of life scores than females (p-value = 0.018), however this was not seen in controls. CONCLUSION An episode of pneumococcal meningitis results in a long-term decrement in overall health related quality of life and is significantly related to hearing loss.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria set a goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50{\%} by 2020, but the extent of inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use is unknown. OBJECTIVE To estimate the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by age and diagnosis, and the estimated portions of antibiotic use that may be inappropriate in adults and children in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, annual numbers and population-adjusted rates with 95{\%} confidence intervals of ambulatory visits with oral antibiotic prescriptions by age, region, and diagnosis in the United States were estimated. EXPOSURES Ambulatory care visits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Based on national guidelines and regional variation in prescribing, diagnosis-specific prevalence and rates of total and appropriate antibiotic prescriptions were determined. These rates were combined to calculate an estimate of the appropriate annual rate of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population. RESULTS Of the 184,032 sampled visits, 12.6{\%} of visits (95{\%} CI, 12.0{\%}-13.3{\%}) resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. Sinusitis was the single diagnosis associated with the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56 antibiotic prescriptions [95{\%} CI, 48-64]), followed by suppurative otitis media (47 antibiotic prescriptions [95{\%} CI, 41-54]), and pharyngitis (43 antibiotic prescriptions [95{\%} CI, 38-49]). Collectively, acute respiratory conditions per 1000 population led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95{\%} CI, 198-245) annually, but only 111 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate for these conditions. Per 1000 population, among all conditions and ages combined in 2010-2011, an estimated 506 antibiotic prescriptions (95{\%} CI, 458-554) were written annually, and, of these, 353 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate antibiotic prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated annual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506, but only an estimated 353 antibiotic prescriptions were likely appropriate, supporting the need for establishing a goal for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.},

METHODS We used the National Health Insurance claims data from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2012. For 1625 primary clinics randomly sampled, we included all claims with principal diagnoses of acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs, J00-J06), acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs, J20-J22), or otitis media (H65, H66). An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted. RESULTS Pharmaceutical spending per claim dropped immediately after the outpatient prescription incentive program only for otitis media (adults), but the secular trend shifted downward after the incentive program for all target diseases. The incentive program lowered the trend of antibiotic prescribing rate in otitis media (adults). The program was associated with an increase of the number of antibiotics prescribed in URTI (adults) and LRTI (children) and decrease in otitis media (adults). The broad markdown of drug prices reduced pharmaceutical expenditures immediately for all diseases, but without lasting effect. CONCLUSION The direct financial incentives to physicians to reduce in prescription spending had the intended effect over time and can be an important tool to improve pharmaceutical spending management.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Data on the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of S.pneumoniae in all age groups are important to help predict the impact of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) into routine infant immunization, given the important indirect effect of the vaccine. Yet most carriage studies are limited to children under five years of age. We here explore the association between carriage prevalence and serotype distribution in children aged ≥5 years and in adults compared to children. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies providing carriage estimates across age groups in healthy populations not previously exposed to PCV, using MEDLINE and Embase. We used Bayesian linear meta-regression models to predict the overall carriage prevalence as well as the prevalence and distribution of vaccine and nonvaccine type (VT and NVT) serotypes in older age groups as a function of that in {\textless}5 y olds. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies compromising of 20,391 individuals were included in the analysis. In all studies nasopharyngeal carriage decreased with increasing age. We found a strong positive linear association between the carriage prevalence in pre-school childen ({\textless}5 y) and both that in school aged children (5-17 y olds) and in adults. The proportion of VT serotypes isolated from carriers was consistently lower in older age groups and on average about 73{\%} that of children {\textless}5 y among 5-17 y olds and adults respectively. We provide a prediction model to infer the carriage prevalence and serotype distribution in 5-17 y olds and adults as a function of that in children {\textless}5 years of age. CONCLUSION: Such predictions are helpful for assessing the potential population-wide effects of vaccination programmes, e.g. via transmission models, and thus assist in the design of future pneumococcal conjugate vaccination strategies.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), such as bacteremic pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and sepsis, and non-IPDs, such as otitis media, nonbacteremic pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infections. It was estimated in 2000 that, worldwide, S. pneumoniae was responsible for 826,000 deaths annually in children aged between 1 month and 5 years. A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in 2000 in the USA and in 2001 in Europe. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed to identify studies assessing the impact of routine childhood PCV7 vaccination on pneumococcal morbidity and mortality. Here, the impact on IPD is reported. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles reporting impact data on IPD were included in this review: four from Australia, 17 from western Europe, and 16 from North America. In vaccine-eligible children in the postvaccination period, a reduction ranging from 39.9{\%} in Spain to 99.1{\%} in the USA in vaccine-type (VT) IPD incidence, compared with the prevaccination period, was reported in 18 studies. All but one of the 30 studies assessing the impact of PCV7 on all-type IPD reported a reduction ranging from 1.7{\%} in Spain to 76.3{\%} in Australia. In addition, the majority of studies reported reductions in VT and all-type IPD incidence in age groups that were not vaccine eligible. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this review illustrate that PCV7 has had a significant impact on IPD across all ages through its use in pediatric immunization programs. With the introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) further reductions in the incidence of IPD due to the six additional serotypes included, as well as continued protection against IPD due to PCV7 serotypes may be expected. Robust surveillance systems are essential for the evaluation of the impact of PCV13 on all-type IPD and for monitoring the evolution of non-VT IPD.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To estimate Swedish experience-based value sets for EQ-5D health states using general population health survey data.

METHODS: Approximately 45,000 individuals valued their current health status by means of time trade off (TTO) and visual analogue scale (VAS) methods and answered the EQ-5D questionnaire, making it possible to model the association between the experience-based TTO and VAS values and the EQ-5D dimensions and severity levels. The association between TTO and VAS values and the different severity levels of respondents' answers on a self-rated health (SRH) question was assessed.

RESULTS: Almost all dimensions (except usual activity) and severity levels had less impact on TTO valuations compared with the UK study based on hypothetical values. Anxiety/depression had the greatest impact on both TTO and VAS values. TTO and VAS values were consistently related to SRH. The inclusion of age, sex, education and socioeconomic group affected the main effect coefficients and the explanatory power modestly.

CONCLUSIONS: A value set for EQ-5D health states based on Swedish valuations has been lacking. Several authors have recently advocated the normative standpoint of using experience-based values. Guidelines of economic evaluation for reimbursement decisions in Sweden recommend the use of experience-based values for QALY calculations. Our results that anxiety/depression had the greatest impact on both TTO and VAS values underline the importance of mental health for individuals' overall HRQoL. Using population surveys is in line with recent thinking on valuing health states and could reduce some of the focusing effects potentially appearing in hypothetical valuation studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria which are metabolically active yet unable to be cultured and eradicated by antibiotic treatment are present in the middle ear effusion of children with chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) and recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM). These observations are suggestive of biofilm presence or intracellular sequestration of bacteria and may play a role in OM pathogenesis. The aim of this project is to provide evidence for the presence of otopathogenic bacteria intracellularly or within biofilm in the middle ear mucosa of children with COME or rAOM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Middle ear mucosal biopsies from 20 children with COME or rAOM were examined for otopathogenic bacteria (either in biofilm or located intracellularly) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or species specific fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). One healthy control biopsy from a child undergoing cochlear implant surgery was also examined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No bacteria were observed in the healthy control sample. In 2 of the 3 biopsies imaged using TEM, bacteria were observed in mucus containing vacuoles within epithelial cells. Bacterial species within these could not be identified and biofilm was not observed. Using FISH with CLSM, bacteria were seen in 15 of the 17 otitis media mucosal specimens. In this group, 11 (65{\%}) of the 17 middle ear mucosal biopsies showed evidence of bacterial biofilm and 12 demonstrated intracellular bacteria. 52{\%} of biopsies were positive for both biofilm and intracellular bacteria. At least one otopathogen was identified in 13 of the 15 samples where bacteria were present. No differences were observed between biopsies from children with COME and those with rAOM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Using FISH and CLSM, bacterial biofilm and intracellular infection with known otopathogens are demonstrated on/in the middle ear mucosa of children with COME and/or rAOM. While their role in disease pathogenesis remains to be determined, this previously undescribed infection pattern may help explain the ineffectiveness of current treatment strategies at preventing or resolving COME or rAOM.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Scotland introduced PCV7 and PCV13 immunisation in young children in 2006 and 2010 respectively. One recent study from the United States reported a decrease in hospitalisation rates for all-cause pneumonia most notably in adults older than 75 years of age following PCV7 introduction in the US child population. We aimed to examine the effect of PCV7 and PCV13 on hospitalisation rates for all-cause pneumonia across all age groups in Scotland. METHODS We linked hospital records and death certification datasets for the entire Scottish population for the period 2000 to 2012. We included all cases where the primary / secondary diagnosis was pneumonia. Differences in hospital admission rates for pneumonia by age group were calculated using the difference in average annual rates for each period. RESULTS We estimated that all-cause pneumonia hospitalisation rates in children {\textless}2 years decreased by about 30 {\%} in the post-PCV-13 period compared with the pre-PCV period. However, in adults aged 75-84 years and ≥85 years, all-cause pneumonia hospitalisation rates increased by 63 and 46 {\%} respectively in the post-PCV 13 period compared to the pre-PCV period. This resulted in an additional 7000 hospitalisations across all age groups in Scotland in 2012 about half of which were in adults {\textgreater}75 years. At the same time, the median length of hospital stay decreased by a third in children {\textless}2 years and by about 20 {\%} in adults {\textgreater}75 years in the post-PCV13 period compared to the pre-PCV period. Additionally, there was an 11 {\%} reduction in deaths due to all-cause pneumonia, and 30 {\%} reduction in pneumococcal hospitalisations across all age groups in the post-PCV13 period compared with pre-PCV period. DISCUSSION The modest and sustained decline in the rates of hospitalisation for all-cause pneumonia in children and the reduction in proportion of pneumonia hospitalisations in children coded as pneumococcal disease in the post-PCV period should alleviate concerns that pneumococcal serotype replacement may have resulted in an increased pneumonia burden in this age group. The indirect impact of child PCV immunisation in those not vaccinated (in terms of reduction in all-cause pneumonia hospitalisations in the elderly) has not been seen in Scotland. Our results are likely to be confounded by changes in clinical coding and healthcare practices over the same period. CONCLUSIONS Our results illustrate that health care planners cannot, with confidence, predict indirect PCV vaccine impacts on hospitalisations. IPD surveillance across all age groups is needed to assess the indirect effects of PCV in the community.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood infection. Baseline data are required to evaluate potential changes in the epidemiology of AOM with new public health measures. AIM To estimate the incidence of AOM in children under five years of age in primary care in New Zealand. METHODS Using a cohort study design, consultation notes from 1 November 2008 to 31 October 2009 from 63 primary care facilities were analysed for new and recurrent episodes of AOM, complications, antimicrobial use and outcome. RESULTS There were 19 146 children in the sample. The raw incidence of AOM was 273 per 1000 children (27.3{\%}; 95{\%} CI 216-330). Of the 3885 children, 2888 (74{\%}) had one episode of AOM and 152 (4{\%}) of these children developed recurrent AOM. Incidence declined with age. There was no difference in incidence between Maori, Pacific and 'Other' ethnicities. Antibiotics were used to treat 2653 (51{\%}) AOM episodes and 113 (4.3{\%}) of these children re-presented within three days of antibiotic therapy for persistent symptoms. Tympanic membrane perforation was the only complication noted, observed in 62 (1{\%}) episodes. DISCUSSION These data indicate that AOM is an important and frequent childhood infection in New Zealand. The show a significant decline in the use of antibiotics to manage AOM in concordance with accepted best practice. The complication rate of AOM is likely under-represented. This study enables future research into the effectiveness of current and future immunisations and changing management practices in New Zealand.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES In 2010, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) replaced the 7-valent vaccine (introduced in 2006) for vaccination against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), pneumonia and acute otitis media (AOM) in the UK. Using recent evidence on the impact of PCVs and epidemiological changes in the UK, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to compare the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) with PCV-13 in the ongoing national vaccination programme. DESIGN CEA was based on a published Markov model. The base-case scenario accounted only for direct medical costs. Work days lost were considered in alternative scenarios. SETTING Calculations were based on serotype and disease-specific vaccine efficacies, serotype distributions and UK incidence rates and medical costs. POPULATION Health benefits and costs related to IPD, pneumonia and AOM were accumulated over the lifetime of a UK birth cohort. INTERVENTIONS Vaccination of infants at 2, 4 and 12 months with PHiD-CV or PCV-13, assuming complete coverage and adherence. OUTCOME MEASURES The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was computed by dividing the difference in costs between the programmes by the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). RESULTS Under our model assumptions, both vaccines had a similar impact on IPD and pneumonia, but PHiD-CV generated a greater reduction in AOM cases (161 918), AOM-related general practitioner consultations (31 070) and tympanostomy tube placements (2399). At price parity, PHiD-CV vaccination was dominant over PCV-13, saving 734 QALYs as well as {\pounds}3.68 million to the National Health Service (NHS). At the lower list price of PHiD-CV, the cost-savings would increase to {\pounds}45.77 million. CONCLUSIONS This model projected that PHiD-CV would provide both incremental health benefits and cost-savings compared with PCV-13 at price parity. Using PHiD-CV could result in substantial budget savings to the NHS. These savings could be used to implement other life-saving interventions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the introduction and routine use of seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease within the Northern California Kaiser Permanente (KP) population. METHODS: Surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease has been in place within KP since 1995. Isolates from normally sterile sites in children are routinely sent for serotyping. Cases of invasive disease are identified through review of automated microbiology records within KP. Incidence rates of invasive disease were compared for the period before and after routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children. RESULTS: The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes before the licensure and routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ranged between 51.52 and 98.15 cases per 100 000 person years in children {\textless}1 year of age and fell to 9.35 after introduction of vaccine. The incidence in children {\textless}2 years of age was 81.67 to 113.80 before introduction and 38.22 cases per 100 000 person years after introduction of the vaccine into the general population. These reductions in disease rates exceeded the average vaccine coverage substantially in each age group. No increase in disease incidence was observed for possibly cross-reacting serotypes or nonvaccine serotypes. CONCLUSION: The introduction and routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in our population have been associated with a substantial reduction in invasive disease incidence in children {\textless}5 years of age.},

Questionnaires (20 questions on education background, previous AOM experience, knowledge on antimicrobial resistance and attitude vs the WW approach) were filled by 600 parents (150 at each centers) of children {\textless} 6 years of age. RESULTS Mothers represented 69{\%} of parents; 2{\%} had an education of {\textless} 10 school years, 46{\%} had high-school education and 17{\%} had an academic degree. 69{\%} parents reported previous experience with AOM and 56{\%} thought that antibiotics represent the only treatment for AOM. Knowledge on bacterial resistance to antibiotics was reported by 57{\%} of the parents; 86{\%} parents were willing to accept/probably accept the WW approach for their children. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between parental education and knowledge about bacterial resistance to antibiotics and that previous experience with AOM was significantly associated with reluctance to accept the WW approach. More parents with knowledge on bacterial resistance were willing to accept the WW approach compared with parents without such knowledge. No correlation was found between the education level and willingness to accept the WW approach.

OBJECTIVE To augment previous catalogues of preference-based health-related quality-of-life weights by estimating preference-based Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) multiattribute utility scores associated with a wide range of childhood conditions. METHODS Data for 2236 children from the "Disability Survey 2000: Survey of Young People With a Disability and Sport" formed the basis of this investigation. Ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and censored least absolute deviations(CLAD) regression methods were used to estimate adjusted marginal disutilities for each condition from 2 thresholds: 1) a threshold of 1.0 representing perfect health and 2) a normative childhood utility threshold. RESULTS Prespecified statistical tests indicated a preference for the OLS regression model over the Tobit and CLAD models. The unadjusted mean, median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile HUI3 multiattribute utility scores and adjusted marginal disutilities are presented for 43 conditions. Notably, based on the OLS estimator, the adjusted marginal disutilities for hydrocephalus; learning and physical disabilities; other syndromes and associations; meningitis, encephalitis, and other infections of the central nervous system; and microcephaly were estimated at -0.889 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: -0.727, -1.000), -0.858 (95{\%} CI: -0.727, -0.989), -0.838 (95{\%} CI: -0.668, -1.000), -0.826(95{\%} CI: -0.677, -0.975), and -0.820 (95{\%} CI: -0.670, -0.970), respectively, when a perfect health threshold was applied, and -0.814 (95{\%} CI: -0.656, -0.979), -0.783 (95{\%}CI: -0.656, -0.918), -0.763 (95{\%} CI: -0.597, -0.937), -0.751 (95{\%} CI: -0.606, -0.904), and -0.745 (95{\%} CI: -0.598, -0.899), respectively, when a normative childhood utility threshold was applied.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has been suggested to increase the risk of future AOM episodes by causing unfavorable shifts in microbial flora. Because current evidence on this topic is inconclusive and long-term follow-up data are scarce, we wanted to estimate the effect of antibiotic treatment for a first AOM episode occurring during infancy on AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life. METHODS We obtained demographic information and risk factors from data of the Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn, a prospective birth cohort study in which all healthy newborns born in Leidsche Rijn (between 2001 and 2012), The Netherlands, were enrolled. These data were linked to children's primary care electronic health records up to the age of four. Children with at least one family physician-diagnosed AOM episode before the age of two were included in analyses. The exposure of interest was the prescription of oral antibiotics (yes vs no) for a child's first AOM episode before the age of two years. RESULTS 848 children were included in analyses and 512 (60{\%}) children were prescribed antibiotics for their first AOM episode. Antibiotic treatment was not associated with an increased risk of total AOM recurrences (adjusted rate ratio: 0.94, 95{\%} CI: 0.78-1.13), recurrent AOM (≥3 episodes in 6 months or ≥4 in one year; adjusted risk ratio: 0.79, 95{\%} CI: 0.57-1.11), or with increased AOM-related health care utilization during children's first four years of life. CONCLUSIONS Oral antibiotic treatment of a first AOM episode occurring during infancy does not affect the number of AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life. This information can be used when weighing the pros and cons of various AOM treatment options.},

Three periods were compared: (1) 1995-1997 when all enrolled received standard dose amoxicillin (40-50 mg/kg/day divided 3 times daily) as the initial empiric treatment; (2) 1998-2000 when all received high dose amoxicillin (80-100 mg/kg/day divided twice daily); and (3) 2001-2003 when high dose amoxicillin and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations were used. RESULTS: Persistent AOM or AOMTF for which tympanocentesis was performed occurred in 195 (16.2{\%}) of 1,207, 204 (16.1{\%}) of 1,278 and 152 (12.3{\%}) of 1,232 AOM visits for 1995-1997, 1998-2000 and 2001-2003, respectively; the 24{\%} decline in 2001-2003 in persistent AOM and AOMTF was significant (P = 0.007). Middle ear aspirates grew Streptococcus pneumoniae (48, 44 and 31{\%}) and Haemophilus influenzae (38, 43 and 57{\%}) for time periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively. There was a significant decline in S. pneumoniae (P = 0.017) and increase in H. influenzae (P = 0.012) isolations and of H. influenzae that were beta-lactamase-producing (P = 0.04) among middle ear fluid isolates. Also there was a trend for an increased proportion of S. pneumoniae in 2001-2003 that were penicillin-susceptible (P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, persistent AOM and AOMTF has decreased in frequency since the introduction of high dose amoxicillin therapy and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. It appears that H. influenzae has become the predominant pathogen of persistent AOM and AOMTF since universal immunization with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Fewer S. pneumoniae AOM isolates are penicillin-resistant and more H. influenzae are beta-lactamase-producing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2006, RotaTeq (RV5) was recommended for routine vaccination of United States (US) infants. We compared hospitalization rates for acute gastroenteritis among US children aged {\textless}5 years during pre-RV5 rotavirus seasons from 2000 through 2006 with those during the post-RV5 2007 and 2008 seasons. METHODS: Using 100{\%} hospital discharge data from 18 states, accounting for 49{\%} of the US population, we calculated acute gastroenteritis hospitalization rates for children aged {\textless}5 years by rotavirus season, 8 age groups (0-2, 3-5, 6-11, 12-17, 18-23, 24-35, 36-47, and 48-59 months), and state. RESULTS: Compared with the median rate for the 2000-2006 rotavirus seasons (101.1 hospitalizations per 10,000 children), the rates for 2007 and 2008 (85.5 and 55.5 hospitalizations per 10,000 children) were 16{\%} and 45{\%} lower, respectively. Children aged 0-2 months had a 28{\%} reduction, those aged 6-23 months had a reduction of 50{\%}, and children aged 3-5 months and 24-59 months had reductions ranging between 42{\%} and 45{\%} during the 2008 rotavirus season, compared with the median rate for 2000-2006 rotavirus seasons. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the RV5 vaccine was associated with a dramatic reduction in hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis among US children during the 2008 rotavirus season.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite immunization with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance makes Streptococcus pneumoniae a continuing threat to child health. Data on carriage of resistant organisms by healthy children in communities in which immunization with PCV7 has been implemented will help to define and decrease these risks further. METHODS: Children who were {\textless}7 years old, resided in a study community, and presented for routine well care or a "sick" visit between March 13 and May 11, 2001, at 31 primary care practices in 16 geographically distinct Massachusetts communities were studied. Consenting parents provided demographic information and data on potential risk factors for carriage of S pneumoniae and of penicillin-nonsusceptible S pneumoniae (PNSP). S pneumoniae isolates from nasopharyngeal specimens were tested for resistance to commonly used antibiotics including penicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Isolates were serotyped and grouped into PCV7-included serotypes, potentially cross-reactive serotypes (ie, an organism of a serogroup included in the vaccine), or non-PCV7 serotypes. Diagnosis on the day of collection, history of recent antibiotic use, and history of PCV7 immunization were obtained by chart review. Separate bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify correlates of colonization with S pneumoniae and colonization with PNSP, accounting for clustering within communities. RESULTS: S pneumoniae was isolated from the nasopharynx of 190 (26{\%}) of the 742 children studied. Of the 166 tested, 33{\%} were nonsusceptible to penicillin, with 14{\%} showing intermediate susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 0.12-1.0) and 19{\%} fully resistant (MIC {\textgreater} or =2). Nonsusceptibility to other antibiotics was common, including ceftriaxone (14{\%}), erythromycin (22{\%}), and trimethoprim/sulfa (31{\%}); 20{\%} of S pneumoniae isolates were not susceptible to {\textgreater} or =3 antibiotics. Thirty-six percent of isolates were of serotypes covered by PCV7; 30{\%} were of PCV7 serogroups and potentially cross-reactive, but not 1 of the 7 included serotypes; and 34{\%} were unrelated to PCV7 serogroups. Nonsusceptibility to penicillin was more common in PCV7-included strains (45{\%}) and potentially cross-reactive strains (51{\%}) than in non-PCV7 serotypes (8{\%}). Risk factors for PNSP colonization included child care attendance (odds ratio [OR]: 3.9; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 2.3-6.5), current respiratory tract infection (OR: 4.7; 95{\%} CI: 2.5-8.6), and recent antibiotic use (OR: 1.7; 95{\%} CI: 1.0-2.8). PCV7 immunization was associated with decreased carriage of PCV7-included serotypes but not with an overall decrease in S pneumoniae colonization or with a decline in PNSP colonization. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicommunity sample, pneumococcal antibiotic resistance was common and was most frequently found in PCV7-included and PCV7 serogroup strains. The long-term impact of PCV7 immunization will be partially determined by the protection that it affords against invasive infection with potentially cross-reactive serotypes, as well as the virulence and future resistance patterns of unrelated serotypes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE This study evaluated the costs and utility of observation and routine antibiotic treatment options for children with acute otitis media. METHODS The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed among children aged 6 months to 12 years seen in primary care offices. The interventions studied were watchful waiting as practiced in the Netherlands, delayed prescription, 5 days of amoxicillin, and 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS In the base case analysis, delayed prescription was the least costly option and 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin was the most effective. The incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) of 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin compared with delayed prescription was 56,000 dollars per QALY gained. Watchful waiting and 5 days of amoxicillin were inferior options. The results were sensitive to the rate of nonattendance in the delayed prescription strategy: when the rate was less than 23{\%}, watchful waiting was the least costly option and delayed prescription was an inferior option. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which all model variables were simultaneously varied, showed with 95{\%} certainty that compared with delayed prescription, 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin had a 61{\%} probability of having an ICUR of greater than 50,000 dollars per QALY gained, and watchful waiting had a 23{\%} probability of having an ICUR of less than 50,000 dollars per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS Economically, an approach to the treatment of acute otitis media with either an initial period of observation or routine treatment with amoxicillin is reasonable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A national 5-year follow-up study of infection-specific antibiotic use in primary care was conducted to see if prescribing practices change after implementing new treatment guidelines. METHODS: The data were collected during 1 week of November each year from 1998 to 2002 from 30 health care centers that covered a total population of 819,777 persons and in 2002 from 20 control health care centers that covered a population of 545,098 persons. National guidelines for 6 major infections (otitis media, sinusitis, throat infection, acute bronchitis, urinary tract infection, and bacterial skin infection) were published in 1999-2000. Multifaceted interventions were performed by local trainers teaching his or her coworkers, supported by feedback and patient and public information. RESULTS: The 6 infections targeted for intervention, together with unspecified upper respiratory tract infection constituted 80{\%}-85{\%} of all infections. The proportion of patients who received prescriptions for antibiotics did not change significantly. However, use of first-line antibiotics increased for all infections, and the change was significant for sinusitis (P{\textless}.001), acute bronchitis (P=.015), and urinary tract infections (P=.009). Also, the percentage of antibiotic treatments prescribed for the recommended duration increased significantly. Correct prescribing for respiratory tract infections improved by 6.4 percentage units (P{\textless}.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in performance between study and control health care centers at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate qualitative improvements in antibiotic use were observed after multifaceted intervention, but prescribing for unjustified indications, mainly acute bronchitis, did not decrease. Obtained infection-specific information on management of patients with infections in primary health care is an important basis for planning targeted interventions in the future.},

The percentage of prescriptions for unspecified upper respiratory tract infection ranged from 7{\%} to 12{\%}. More than one-third (33{\%}–40{\%}) of all antibiotics for sinusitis and 33{\%}–43{\%} for acute bronchitis were prescribed for patients who had had symptoms for !8 days.},

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common, but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis. Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed. Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge of serotypes that cause non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBP). Here we report serotypes, their associated disease potential and coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in adults with NBP and compare these to bacteremic pneumonia (BP).

METHODS: Adults with pneumonia and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from the lower respiratory tract or blood were included 1 year in a population-based design in Denmark. Pneumonia was defined as a new infiltrate on chest radiograph in combination with clinical symptoms or elevated white blood count or plasma C-reactive protein. All isolates were serotyped using type-specific pneumococcal rabbit antisera. All values are medians with interquartile ranges.

RESULTS: There were 272 cases of NBP and 192 cases of BP. Ninety-nine percent were hospitalized. NBP and BP cases were of comparable age and sex but NBP cases had more respiratory symptoms and less severe disease compared to BP cases. In total, 46 different serotypes were identified. Among NBP cases, 5 serotypes accounted for nearly a third of isolates. PCV10 and -13 types covered 17{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 11-23{\%}) and 34{\%} (95{\%} CI: 25-43{\%}) of NBP isolates, respectively. In contrast, the five most frequent serotypes accounted for two-thirds of BP isolates. PCV10 and -13 types covered 39{\%} (95{\%} CI: 30-48{\%}) and 64{\%} (95{\%} CI: 48-79) of BP isolates, respectively. More severe NBP disease was associated with infection with invasive serotypes while there was an inverse relationship for BP.

CONCLUSIONS: Only a third of cases of adult non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia would potentially be preventable with the use of PCV13 and just one sixth of cases with the use of PCV10 indicating that PCVs with increased valency are needed to increase vaccine coverage for NBP in adults. PCV13 could potentially prevent two-thirds of adult bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.},

There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication.The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website (http://www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp).We hope CHEERS will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the CHEERS statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse CHEERS. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.},

abstract = {Background: Antibiotic drug consumption is a major driver of antibiotic resistance. Variations in antibiotic resistance across countries are attributable, in part, to different volumes and patterns for antibiotic consumption. We aimed to assess variations in consumption to assist monitoring of the rise of resistance and development of rational-use policies and to provide a baseline for future assessment. Methods: With use of sales data for retail and hospital pharmacies from the IMS Health MIDAS database, we reviewed trends for consumption of standard units of antibiotics between 2000 and 2010 for 71 countries. We used compound annual growth rates to assess temporal differences in consumption for each country and Fourier series and regression methods to assess seasonal differences in consumption in 63 of the countries. Findings: Between 2000 and 2010, consumption of antibiotic drugs increased by 36{\%} (from 54 083 964 813 standard units to 73 620 748 816 standard units). Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa accounted for 76{\%} of this increase. In most countries, antibiotic consumption varied significantly with season. There was increased consumption of carbapenems (45{\%}) and polymixins (13{\%}), two last-resort classes of antibiotic drugs. Interpretation: The rise of antibiotic consumption and the increase in use of last-resort antibiotic drugs raises serious concerns for public health. Appropriate use of antibiotics in developing countries should be encouraged. However, to prevent a striking rise in resistance in low-income and middle-income countries with large populations and to preserve antibiotic efficacy worldwide, programmes that promote rational use through coordinated efforts by the international community should be a priority.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To study the epidemiology of acute otitis media (AOM), especially the otitis-prone condition, during the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 7 and 13 era. METHODS Six hundred and fifteen children were prospectively managed from 6 to 36 months of life during a 10-year time frame (June 2006-June 2016). All clinical diagnoses of AOM were confirmed by tympanocentesis and bacterial culture of middle ear fluid. RESULTS By 1 year of age, 23{\%} of the children experienced ≥1 episode of AOM; by 3 years of age, 60{\%} had ≥1 episodes of AOM, and 24{\%} had ≥3 episodes. The peak incidence occurred at 6 to 12 months of life. Multivariable analysis of demographic and environmental data revealed a significantly increased risk of AOM associated with male sex, non-Hispanic white race, family history of recurrent AOM, day care attendance, and early occurrence of AOM. Risk factors for stringently defined (tympanocentesis-confirmed) otitis proneness, in which children suffered at least 3 episodes of AOM in a 6-month period or at least 4 within a year, were male sex, day care attendance, and family history of AOM, whereas breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life was protective. Stringently defined otitis prone children were also likely to experience their first AOM episode at a younger age. The proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis causing AOM had dynamic changes during the past decade. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the epidemiology but not the risk factors for AOM have undergone substantial changes since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.},

abstract = {Studies of microorganisms involved in otitis media in children often use a nasopharyngeal sample as a proxy for the middle ear fluid to test for bacteria and viruses. The question is whether such studies provide an accurate estimate of the prevalence of microorganisms involved in otitis media. We performed a systematic review of the literature reporting on the concordance between test results of nasopharyngeal and middle ear fluid samples for the most prevalent microorganisms in children with otitis media. Our findings show that the concordances vary from 68{\%} to 97{\%} per microorganism. For the most prevalent microbes, positive predictive values are around 50{\%}. Most negative predictive values are moderate to high, with a range from 68{\%} up to 97{\%}. These results indicate that test results from nasopharyngeal samples do not always provide an accurate proxy for those of the middle ear fluid. It is important to interpret and use results of such studies carefully.},

abstract = {The density and duration of pneumococcal carriage are considered to affect the likelihood of transmission and invasive disease. Because of its importance in both spreading and causing disease, carriage has been suggested as an endpoint in future vaccine studies. Culture is the current gold standard for detection, but may not be sensitive enough to detect changes at low density. Healthy adult volunteers received an intranasal inoculation of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6B. Pneumococcal density in nasal washes collected at six time-points post-inoculation was determined by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Natural pneumococcal carriers detected at initial screening were followed in parallel. In 331 nasal washes from 79 volunteers, the sensitivity and specificity of pneumococcal detection by qPCR, as compared with culture, were 92.3{\%} and 75.9{\%}. The estimation of pneumococcal density by culture and qPCR was highly correlated (rs = 0.73, p {\textless}0.0001), although qPCR had a lower detection limit. Pneumococcal density fluctuated within a carriage episode, and occasionally fell below the detection limit of both methods. The duration of carriage episodes was underestimated when only one method was used. Similar fluctuations in density were observed in natural carriers. Pneumococcal carriage is a dynamic event. Culture and qPCR are complementary for surveying the density and duration of pneumococcal carriage episodes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of the heptavalent CRM197 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in low birth weight (LBW) and preterm (PT) infants against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine types. METHODS: In a randomized double blind trial of 37,868 infants given either PCV or meningococcal type C conjugate vaccine (MCV), 1756 infants {\textless}750 g {\textless}2500 g (LBW) and 4340 infants from 32 to {\textless}38 weeks old (PT) were identified. Risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in LBW and PT infants was compared with risk in normal birth weight (NBW) and full term (FT) infants. Local and systemic events observed within 48 h of recent vaccine were assessed by telephone interviews and similar comparisons made. Premature infant Emergency Department visits and hospitalization were also identified and compared with FT and NBW infants. RESULTS: Initiation of immunization and intervals between doses were similar for all groups. The risk ratio for invasive pneumococcal diseases for LBW infants compared with NBW infants was 2.6 (P = 0.03), and for PT compared with FT infants the risk ratio was 1.6 (P = 0.06). Vaccine efficacy for both groups was 100{\%}. PCV was as immunogenic in LBW and PT as in NBW and FT infants. Fever and local events after PCV vaccination were similar when adjusted for clustering among multiple doses per child. When stratified for individual doses there was more redness and swelling for LBW infants and more swelling for PT infants after Dose 3. Isolated local and systemic reactions were more commonly seen with PCV than with MCV, a pattern similar to that in NBW and FT infants. Hospitalization rates were similar for PCV and MCV recipients. CONCLUSION: These data support the use of PCV in LBW infants and PT infants.},

abstract = {Swedish studies on antibiotic use in primary care have been based on one-week registrations of infections. In order to study adherence to guidelines, analyses based on large databases that provide information on diagnosis linked prescriptions, are needed. This study describes trends in management of infections in Swedish primary care particularly with regards to antibiotic prescribing and adherence to national guidelines. A descriptive study of Sweden's largest database regarding diagnosis linked antibiotic prescription data, the Primary care Record of Infections in Sweden (PRIS), for the years 2008, 2010 and 2013. Although the consultation rate for all infections remained around 30{\%} each year, antibiotic prescribing rates decreased significantly over the years from 53.7{\%} in 2008, to 45.5{\%} in 2010, to 38.6{\%} in 2013 (p = .032). The antibiotic prescribing rate for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) decreased from 40.5{\%} in 2008 to 24.9{\%} in 2013 while those for urinary tract infections and skin and soft tissue infections were unchanged. For most RTI diagnoses there was a decrease in prescription rate from 2008 to 2013, particularly for the age group 0–6 years. Phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV) was the antibiotic most often prescribed, followed by tetracycline. Tonsillitis and acute otitis media were the two RTI diagnoses with the highest number of prescriptions per 1000 patient years (PY). For these diagnoses an increase in adherence to national guidelines was seen, with regards to treatment frequency, choice of antibiotics and use of rapid antigen detection test. The frequency in antibiotic prescribing varied greatly between different Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCCs). Falling numbers of consultations and decreased antibiotic prescription rates for RTIs have reduced the antibiotic use in Swedish primary care substantially. Overprescribing of antibiotics could still be suspected due to large variability in prescribing frequency, especially for acute bronchitis and sinusitis. Continuous evaluation of diagnosis linked prescribing data and feedback to doctors is essential in order to achieve a more prudent antibiotic use.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a very common early infancy and childhood disease. The marginal benefits of antibiotics on AOM, the increasing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, and the huge estimated direct and indirect annual costs associated with otitis media (OM) have prompted a search for effective vaccines to prevent AOM. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in preventing AOM in children up to 12 years of age. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, issue 2), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1995 to November 2007); and EMBASE (January 1995 to November 2007). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of PCVs to prevent AOM in children aged 12 years or younger, with a follow up of at least six months after vaccination. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and two review authors extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included seven trials on 7- to 11-valent PCV (with different carrier proteins). There was large heterogeneity regarding study population, type of conjugate vaccine, and outcome measures between trials, therefore, results were not pooled. The only currently licensed 7-valent PCV Prevenar with CRM197 as carrier protein (CRM197-PCV7) administered during infancy was in two studies associated with a 6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -4{\%} to 16{\%}) and 7{\%} (95{\%} CI 4{\%} to 9{\%}) relative reduction in risk of AOM episodes. Another 7-valent PCV with the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) serogroup B as carrier protein, administered in infancy, did not reduce overall AOM episodes, while an 11-valent PCV with Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) protein D as carrier protein was associated with a relative reduction in risk of AOM episodes of 34{\%} (95{\%} CI 21{\%} to 44{\%}). 9-valent PCV (with CRM197 carrier protein) administered in healthy toddlers was associated with a 17{\%} (95{\%} CI -2{\%} to 33{\%}) relative reduction in risk of OM episodes. CRM197-PCV7 followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination administered after infancy in older children with a history of AOM showed no beneficial effect on further AOM episodes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on current evidence of the effectiveness of PCVs for the prevention of AOM, the currently licensed 7-valent PCV administered during infancy has marginal beneficial effects. Discrete reductions of 6{\%} to 7{\%} may mean substantial reductions from a public health perspective. Administering PCV7 in older children with a history of AOM appears to have no benefit in preventing further episodes.},

abstract = {Background: The effect of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in developed countries was enhanced by indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, mediated by reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-serotype pneumococci. The potential indirect protection of 10-valent PCV (PCV10) in a developing country setting is unknown. We sought to estimate the effectiveness of introduction of PCV10 in Kenya against carriage of vaccine serotypes and its effect on other bacteria. Methods: PCV10 was introduced into the infant vaccination programme in Kenya in January, 2011, accompanied by a catch-up campaign in Kilifi County for children aged younger than 5 years. We did annual cross-sectional carriage studies among an age-stratified, random population sample in the 2 years before and 2 years after PCV10 introduction. A nasopharyngeal rayon swab specimen was collected from each participant and was processed in accordance with WHO recommendations. Prevalence ratios of carriage before and after introduction of PCV10 were calculated by log-binomial regression. Findings: About 500 individuals were enrolled each year (total n=2031). Among children younger than 5 years, the baseline (2009-10) carriage prevalence was 34{\%} for vaccine-serotype Streptococcus pneumoniae, 41{\%} for non-vaccine-serotype Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 54{\%} for non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. After PCV10 introduction (2011-12), these percentages were 13{\%}, 57{\%}, and 40{\%}, respectively. Adjusted prevalence ratios were 0??36 (95{\%} CI 0??26-0??51), 1??37 (1??13-1??65), and 0??62 (0??52-0??75), respectively. Among individuals aged 5 years or older, the adjusted prevalence ratios for vaccine-serotype and non-vaccine-serotype S pneumoniae carriage were 0??34 (95{\%} CI 0??18-0??62) and 1??13 (0??92-1??38), respectively. There was no change in prevalence ratio for Staphylococcus aureus (adjusted prevalence ratio for those {\textless}5 years old 1??02, 95{\%} CI 0??52-1??99, and for those ???5 years old 0??90, 0??60-1??35). Interpretation: After programmatic use of PCV10 in Kilifi, carriage of vaccine serotypes was reduced by two-thirds both in children younger than 5 years and in older individuals. These findings suggest that PCV10 introduction in Africa will have substantial indirect effects on invasive pneumococcal disease. Funding: GAVI Alliance and Wellcome Trust.},

The objectives of this study were to evaluate in Korean paediatric outpatients (1) the nationwide pattern of prescribing antibiotics according to age group and medical institution and (2) the adherence of antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infections to both national guidelines and European antibiotic prescribing quality indicators. Method This population-based study used the national insurance reimbursement database for 2011. The study subjects were outpatients younger than 18 years old prescribed systemic antibiotics. Patterns of antibiotic prescription were compared according to diagnostic conditions, age group and medical institution. The disease-specific proportion of recommended antibiotic or quinolone use for acute respiratory tract infections was evaluated on the basis of clinical practice guidelines and European quality indicators. Results The data consisted of 70.7 million prescription records for 7.9 million paediatric outpatients, which means that 79.3{\%} of the whole paediatric population used antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics made up 78.5{\%} of the prescriptions, with broad-spectrum penicillins such as amoxicillin/clavulanate being the most commonly prescribed (50.2{\%}). They were prescribed more commonly in younger paediatric patients (similar to 80{\%}) than in adolescents (66.6{\%}). The leading diagnosis accounting for antibiotic prescription was bronchitis (35.9{\%}). The prescription proportion of recommended antibiotics in the European quality indicators was extremely low compared with the national guidelines: {\textless}0.1{\%} for pharyngotonsillitis and 13.4{\%} for acute otitis media. Conclusions Antibiotic use in children in Korea is inappropriately high. In addition, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used excessively.},

This paper reviews 5 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) trials that used otitis media as an endpoint: Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP; vaccine, 7-valent PCV [PCV7]-CRM); Finnish Otitis Media (FinOM; vaccines, PCV7-CRM or PCV7-OMPC); Native American Trial (vaccine, PCV7-CRM); Pneumococcal Otitis Efficacy Trial (POET; vaccine, 11-valent PCV [PCV11]-PD). For the microbiological endpoint, vaccine efficacy against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal otitis media was about 60{\%} across trials. Against the clinical endpoint of all episodes, vaccine efficacy was 7{\%} (PCV7-CRM/NCKP), 6{\%} (PCV7-CRM/FinOM), -1{\%} (PCV7-OMPC/FinOM), and -0.4{\%} (PCV7-CRM/Native American Trial); 34{\%} against first episodes of ear, nose, and throat specialist-referral cases (PCV11-PD/POET). Both follow-up through 2 years of age, for the 5 trials, and long-term follow-up, for PCV7-CRM/NCKP and PCV7-CRM/FinOM, demonstrated greater vaccine efficacy against recurrent AOM and tympanostomy-tube placement, suggesting that vaccination against early episodes of AOM may prevent subsequent episodes of complicated otitis media. Although study designs varied by primary endpoint measured, age at follow-up, source of middle-ear fluid for culture, case ascertainment, and type of randomization, each clinical trial demonstrated vaccine efficacy against microbiological and/or clinical otitis media.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccination program has successfully reduced morbidity and mortality from serogroup C disease in England and Wales, owing to high short-term vaccine effectiveness and substantial herd immunity. The latter effect was not accounted for in the previous economic analysis of the MCC program. METHODS: The authors applied a transmission dynamic model, which accounts for herd immunity, to reevaluate the cost-effectiveness of MCC vaccination. The direct and indirect benefits of the MCC vaccine strategy implemented in England and Wales were compared. The cost-effectiveness of alternative MCC vaccine strategies, including future changes to the current schedule, were evaluated. RESULTS: The authors found that including herd immunity improved the average cost-effectiveness ratio in all cases, although the extent depended on the vaccine strategy considered. Incremental analysis showed that those strategies that offered 1 dose early in the 2nd year of life dominated strategies that offered 3 doses of vaccine in infancy and that catch-up vaccination up to the age of 18 years was also highly attractive. Furthermore, the authors analyzed the effect of future changes to the routine vaccine schedule and predicted that shifting the age at routine vaccination from 2, 3, and 4 months (3 doses) to 12 months (1 dose) resulted in a net gain in the total number of cases prevented with only a few extra cases occurring in children under 1 year of age. This program dominated the current strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Models that do not include the indirect effects of vaccination will underestimate the impact of MCC vaccination and may lead to distorted decision making.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A dramatic decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was observed among children and adults in the United States after the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). Little is known about the incidence of IPD after PCV7 licensure in Europe. The objective of this study was to examine changes in the prevalence of IPD among adults in the PCV7 era. METHODS: We undertook a prospective study involving adults with IPD who required hospital admission in the southern area of Barcelona, Spain. Three periods were studied: the pre-PCV7 period (1997-2001), the early PCV7 period (2002-2004), and the late PCV7 period (2005-2007). RESULTS: A total of 1007 episodes of IPD were observed. Rates of IPD among adults increased from 13.9 to 14.6 episodes per 100,000 population between the pre-PCV7 period and the early PCV7 period (P = .6) and then to 19.55 episodes per 100,000 population in the late PCV7 period (P {\textless} .001). The rates of IPD among adults due to non-PCV7 serotypes increased from 8.4 to 9.7 episodes per 100,000 population between the pre-PCV7 period and the early PCV7 period (P = .15) and then to 15.3 episodes per 100,000 population in the late PCV7 period (P {\textless} .001); IPD due to PCV7 serotypes decreased from 5.6 to 4.9 episodes per 100,000 population between the pre-PCV7 period and the early PCV7 period (P = .3), then to 4.3 episodes per 100,000 population in the late PCV7 period (P = .056). Among people aged {\textgreater} or = 65 years, IPD due to PCV7 serotypes decreased from 19.5 to 14.6 episodes per 100,000 population between the pre-PCV7 period and the early PCV7 period (P = .13), then to 12.3 episodes per 100,000 population in the late PCV7 period (P = .02). A decrease in the prevalence of antibioticresistant pneumococci in the late PCV7 period was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of multidrugresistant PCV7 clones (Spain(23F)-ST81, Spain(6B)-ST90, and ST88(19F)) and an increase in the prevalence of non-PCV7 antibiotic-susceptible clones (ST306(1), ST191(7F), ST989(12F), and ST433(22F)). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of IPD among adults increased in Barcelona in the late PCV7 period, coinciding with a clonal expansion of non-PCV7 serotypes. In contrast, rates of IPD caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased among people aged {\textgreater} or = 65 years, which suggests the development of a herd immunity.},

The study included 147 patients with a median age of 71 years. Special efforts to diagnose a pneumococcal aetiology were accomplished by antigen detection of the pneumococcal C-polysaccharide (PnC) in sputum and saliva samples and by serological methods for determination of antibody titres against PnC. A pneumococcal aetiology was established in 46.9{\%} of the patients, including 8.1{\%} with double infections. Altogether Haemophilus influenzae A virus were noted in 9.5{\%}, respectively, Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 5.4{\%}, legionnaires' disease in 2.7{\%} and Branhamella catarrhalis in 2.0{\%}, whereas enteric gram-negative bacilli as aetiological organisms were not found in any patient. These findings imply that penicillin should still be the first drug of choice in hospitalized adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Sweden.},

abstract = {Transmission of Streptococcus pneumoniae between children and their parents was evaluated in 29 pairs from 25 families. The serotypes of 35 pneumococcal isolates from 18 (62.1{\%}) of 29 child-parent pairs were identical. Of the 35 isolates, 23 showed intermediate resistance and 10 were fully resistant to penicillin G. PCR indicated that all 35 strains had at least one alteration in penicillin-binding protein genes pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b and 33 strains had macrolide resistance genes mef(A) and/or erm(B). As a result, the PCR patterns of 16 of 18 pairs were identical. Molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that 12 pairs were indistinguishable, 3 pairs were closely related, 2 pairs were possibly related, and only one pair was different.

@article{Paradise1997,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE As part of a long-term study of possible effects of early-life otitis media on speech, language, cognitive, and psychosocial development, we set out to delineate the occurrence and course of otitis media during the first 2 years of life in a sociodemographically diverse population of infants, and to identify related risk factors. METHODS We enrolled healthy infants by age 2 months who presented for primary care at one of two urban hospitals or one of two small town/rural and four suburban private pediatric practices. We intensively monitored the infants' middle-ear status by pneumatic otoscopy, supplemented by tympanometry, throughout their first 2 years of life; we monitored the validity of the otoscopic observations on an ongoing basis; and we treated infants for otitis media according to specified guidelines. RESULTS We followed 2253 infants until age 2 years. The proportions developing {\textgreater} or = 1 episode of middle-ear effusion (MEE) between age 61 days (the starting point for data analysis) and ages 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were 47.8{\%}, 78.9{\%}, and 91.1{\%}. Overall, the mean cumulative proportion of days with MEE was 20.4{\%} in the first year of life and 16.6{\%} in the second year of life. Tympanostomy-tube placement was performed on 1.8{\%} and 4.2{\%} of the infants during the first and second years of life, respectively. By every measure, the occurrence of MEE was highest among urban infants and lowest among suburban infants; these differences were greatest in the earliest months of life. Overall, unadjusted mean cumulative proportions of days with MEE were higher among boys than girls, higher among black than white infants, and higher among Medicaid than private health insurance enrollees. Cumulative proportions of days with MEE varied directly with the number of smokers in the household and with the number of other children to whom infants were exposed, whether at home or in day care, and varied inversely with birth weight, maternal age, level of maternal education, a socioeconomic index, and duration of breastfeeding. After adjustment, using multivariate analysis, the only variables that each remained independently and significantly related to the cumulative proportion of days with MEE were: during the first year of life, study site grouping, sex, the socioeconomic index, breastfeeding for {\textgreater} or = 4 months, the number of smokers in the household, and an index rating the degree of exposure to other children at home or in day care; and during the second year of life, sex, the socioeconomic index, and the child exposure index. The duration of breastfeeding and the degree of exposure to tobacco smoke contributed little to the explained variance; most was attributable to differences in the socioeconomic index and the child exposure index. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to findings in many previous reports, the prevalence of otitis media during the first 2 years of life among lower-socioeconomic-status black infants appears to be as high as, if not higher than among lower-socioeconomic-status white infants, and certainly higher than among middle-class white infants. Among middle-class white infants the prevalence may also be higher than commonly assumed. The most important sociodemographic risk factors for otitis media appear to be low socioeconomic status and repeated exposure to large numbers of other children, whether at home or in day care.},

abstract = {Objectives—This report presents statistics on ambulatory care visits to physician offices, hospital outpatient departments (OPDs), and hospital emergency departments (EDs) in the United States in 2006. Ambulatory medical care utilization is described in terms of patient, practice, facility, and visit characteristics. Methods—Data from the 2006 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) were combined to produce annual estimates of ambulatory medical care utilization. Results—Patients in the United States made an estimated 1.1 billion visits to physician offices and hospital OPDs and EDs, a rate of 381.9 visits per 100 persons annually. The overall visit rate was not significantly different for white and black persons. However, black persons had higher visit rates than white persons to hospital OPDs and EDs and lower visit rates to office-based surgical and medical specialists. Visit distribution by ambulatory care setting differed by poverty level in the patient's ZIP Code of residence, with higher proportions of visits to hospital OPDs and EDs as poverty levels increased. Between 1996 and 2006, visit rates to medical specialty offices climbed overall by 29 percent, with a significant increase noted for white patients but not black patients. The rate of OPD visits jumped from 25.4 visits per 100 persons in 1996 to 34.7 in 2006, whereas ED visits during the same period increased from 34.1 to 40.5 per 100 persons. About 18.3 percent of all ambulatory care visits in 2006 were for nonillness or noninjury conditions, such as routine checkups and pregnancy exams. Seven in ten ambulatory care visits had at least one medication provided, prescribed, or continued in 2006, for a total of 2.6 billion drugs overall. Analgesics were the most common therapeutic category, accounting for 13.6 drugs per 100 drugs prescribed, and they were most often utilized at primary care and ED visits. The percentage of visits at which medication was prescribed increased significantly in most settings between 1996 and 2006.},

abstract = {The nasopharynx of children is often colonised by microorganisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) that can cause infections including pneumonia and otitis media. In this complex environment, bacteria and viruses may impact each other through antagonistic as well as synergistic interactions. Vaccination may alter colonisation dynamics, evidenced by the rise in non-vaccine serotypes following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. Discovery of an inverse relationship between S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus carriage generated concern that pneumococcal vaccination could increase S. aureus carriage and disease. Here we review data on co-colonisation of pathogens in the nasopharynx, focusing on S. pneumoniae and the impact of pneumococcal vaccination. Thus far, pneumococcal vaccination has not had a sustained impact on S. aureus carriage but it is associated with an increase in non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media aetiology. Advances in bacterial and viral detection methodologies have facilitated research in nasopharyngeal microbiology and will aid investigation of potential vaccine-induced changes, particularly when baseline studies can be conducted prior to pneumococcal vaccine introduction. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the perceived disease burden and management of otitis media (OM) among an international cohort of experienced physicians. Methods: A cross-sectional survey conducted in France, Germany, Spain, Poland, Argentina, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and Saudi Arabia. Face-to-face interviews conducted with 1800 physicians (95{\%} paediatricians, 5{\%} family practitioners). Main outcome measures were the perceived burden on clinical practice (number of cases, complications and referrals) and first- and second-line management strategies for OM. Results are expressed as mean and range across the nine countries over three continents. Results: Respondents estimated an average annual caseload of 375 (range 128-1003) children under 5 years of age with OM; 54{\%} (range 44-71{\%}) with an initial episode and 38{\%} (range 27-54{\%}) with recurrent OM (ROM). OM with complications was estimated to be approximately 20 (range 7-49) cases per year and an estimated 15{\%} (8-41{\%}) of children with OM was recalled as needing specialist referral. There was high awareness of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as causative bacterial pathogens: 77{\%} (range 65-91{\%}) and 74{\%} (range 68-83{\%}), respectively, but less recognition of non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi); 59{\%} (range 45-67{\%}). Although concern over antimicrobial resistance was widespread, empirical treatment with antibiotics was the most common first-line treatment (mean 81{\%}, range 40-96{\%}). The burden of disease is substantial enough that many physicians would consider vaccination to prevent OM (mean score 5.1, range 4.3-6.2 on 1-7 scale). Conclusions: This large, multinational survey shows that OM remains a significant burden for clinical practice. Despite awareness of shortcomings, antimicrobial therapy remains the most frequent treatment for OM. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background Vaccines are generally well accepted in most European countries including Iceland. The 10-valent pneumococcal non typeable Haemophilus influenzae Protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10, Synflorix) was introduced into the paediatric vaccination program in Iceland in April 2011 at 3, 5 and 12 months of age. No catch up vaccination was implemented. The aim was to describe the vaccine uptake and coverage. Methods All pneumococcal vaccinations were extracted from the National Vaccine Register (NVR) for the period 2005 - 2015. To mitigate possible omissions in the NVR, all vaccine purchases with Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code J07 were extracted from the National Drug Prescription Database (NDPD) and linked using unique governmental issued personal identification numbers. Proportion of each birth cohort receiving 1, 2 and 3 vaccine doses was calculated and number of children whose parents refused vaccination identified. The daily cumulative proportion of fully vaccinated children 12–36 months of age was calculated. Results 62.267 doses of PCV were administered to 23.374 children from 2005–2015. Proportion of vaccine eligible cohorts (2011–2015) having received 1, 2, and 3 doses was 99.7{\%}, 98.2{\%} and 92.7{\%} respectively compared to 3.1{\%}, 2.2{\%} and 0.7{\%} of vaccine ineligible cohorts (2005 – 2010). Only 56 additional doses were found in the NDPD compared to the NVR. No significant difference in coverage was found between residential areas and gender. 375 parent refusals for 199 children (0.91{\%} of children) were identified. Conclusions PHiD-CV10 uptake was rapid and extensive. A drop in vaccine coverage was noted for the third (12 month) dose compared to the first and second. Widespread vaccine uptake is critical for the success of a vaccination program.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trends in age specific and serotype specific incidence rates for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) were examined in South Australia 4 years before and 5 years after the commencement of the Australian universal childhood 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) program. METHODS: IPD cases were identified by routine enhanced surveillance. IPD serotypes were grouped according to those covered by the 7vPCV, the six serotypes specific to the 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPCV), the 11 serotypes specific to the 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV), as well as non-13vPCV and non-23vPPV groups. Poisson regression was used to calculate age-specific and serotype-specific incident rate ratios (IRRs) comparing pre (2002-2004) and post (2007-2009) universal childhood 7vPCV periods. RESULTS: Following the introduction of the 7vPCV program, the rate of IPD in children aged {\textless}2 years decreased by 81{\%} for all serotypes (IRR 0.19, 95{\%} CI, 0.13-0.28) and by 98{\%} for 7vPCV serotypes (IRR 0.02, 95{\%} CI, 0.007-0.07). At the same time, there was some evidence for an increase in IPD caused by 13vPCV specific serotypes (IRR 1.58, 95{\%} CI, 0.78-3.21) and non-13vPCV serotypes (IRR 1.80, 95{\%} CI, 0.45-7.21). Among adults aged ≥65 years, overall there was a 27{\%} reduction in IPD caused by all serotypes following introduction of the 7vPCV program (IRR 0.73, 95{\%} CI, 0.58-0.93). However, the rate of IPD increased in the last 2 years of the study period. The initial decrease was a result of a 74{\%} reduction in the rate of IPD due to 7vPCV serotypes (IRR 0.26, 95{\%} CI, 0.17-0.40). At the same time, the rate of IPD increased for 13vPCV specific serotypes (IRR 1.55, 95{\%} CI, 0.94-2.54), 23vPPV specific serotypes (IRR 1.91, 95{\%} CI, 0.99-3.71) and particularly non-23vPPV serotypes (IRR 5.3, 95{\%} CI, 1.83-15.34). CONCLUSION: There has been a large direct and sustained benefit from the universal 7vPCV program in children, particularly those aged {\textless}2 years, with some evidence for serotype replacement. There is also good evidence that the childhood program has provided indirect benefits to adults aged ≥65 years, although serotype replacement has reduced the initial benefits.},

Tegund ranns{\'{o}}knar: Routine enhanced surveillance. 


IPD became a notifiable disease under legislation in SA on 1January 2001. This requires all laboratories and medical practition- ers to notify the SA Department of Health of each case of IPD. Basic demographic data is collected at notification and a case note review using a standard enhanced surveillance form provides additional data including risk factors for IPD, clinical presentation and vaccina- tion status. Isolates are also forwarded to the Melbourne Diagnostic Unit},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Most estimates of the incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) are based on general practitioner (GP) or pediatrician diagnoses. It is likely that these figures underestimate the community incidence of AOM since parents do not visit their doctor every time their child suffers from acute ear symptoms. The impact of these symptom episodes may be substantial since they affect the child's quality of life and parents' productivity. METHODS To determine AOM symptoms in the community, we measured parent-reported AOM symptoms daily for 12 consecutive months in 1,260 children participating in a prospective birth cohort in the Netherlands. The mean age of these children was at study enrollment 0.9 months (standard deviation 0.6). A parent-reported AOM symptom episode was defined as fever (temperature 38˚C or above) plus at least one of the following symptoms: ear pain and ear discharge. These febrile AOM symptom episodes were linked to GP-consultations and diagnoses in the GP electronic health records. RESULTS With an estimated 624 parent-reported symptom episodes per 1,000 child-years (95{\%} CI: 577 to 674) incidence of febrile AOM symptoms during the child's first year is high. The GP was consulted in half of these symptom episodes and AOM was diagnosed in 49{\%} of these consultations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The incidence of febrile AOM symptoms in the first year of life is high in Dutch children and leads to a GP-consultation in only half of the cases. This suggests that AOM symptomatology in the community is underestimated when focusing on GP-diagnosed AOM episodes alone, since a considerable proportion of febrile AOM symptom episodes are treated symptomatically by parents at home and do not come to the attention of the GP. Having data on community AOM symptomatology available for each country is important when the potential impact of preventive and therapeutic interventions for AOM are studied.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in all children younger than 5 years of age in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP) health care system during a 5-year surveillance period (2000-2005) after the introduction in April 2000 of routine use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). METHODS: This was a laboratory-based surveillance study of all children younger than 5 years of age in the NCKP health care system from April 2000 to March 2005. The comparison group was all children younger than 5 years of age in the NCKP health care system from April 1996 to March 2000. Data obtained from clinical databases included microbiologic identification and susceptibility testing; serotyping of isolates; immunization records; and IPD diagnoses for inpatients and outpatients. IPD was defined as a positive culture of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site. RESULTS: For all serotypes, the mean annual incidence of IPD during the postlicensure surveillance period was 15.3 cases/100,000 person-years (10(5) p-y) compared with 62.5 cases/10(5) p-y in the prelicensure years of 1996-2000. The average incidence of IPD caused by vaccine serotypes was reduced from 50.1 cases/10(5) p-y during the prelicensure years to 4.9 cases/10(5) p-y during the postlicensure period. The average incidences of IPD caused by cross-reactive and by nonvaccine serotypes were 5.8 and 5.3 cases/10(5) p-y, respectively, during the prelicensure years and 2.5 and 6.2 cases/10(5) p-y, respectively, during the postlicensure period. Of the 131 IPD cases observed during the postlicensure surveillance period, bacteremia (50.4{\%}) and pneumonia (31.3{\%}) were the most common diagnoses. During the 5-year postlicensure surveillance period, only 3 subjects who were identified to be fully vaccinated for age with PCV7 (3 doses by 7 months of age or 4 doses by 18 months of age) developed vaccine-serotype IPD. CONCLUSION: The incidence of IPD has significantly decreased in a large population of children after the introduction of PCV7. Vaccine-type IPD was rare in patients who received full 4-dose immunization with PCV7. There is no clear evidence of a significant increase in nonvaccine-serotype IPD. Introduction of a 4-dose infant schedule of PCV7 into this population has resulted in a marked and sustained reduction of IPD in children.},

abstract = {Objective: To study whether the incidence and characteristics of acute mastoiditis in children changed in Sweden following the introduction of new guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media advocating "watchful waiting" as an option in children 2-16 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media. Methods: The records for all patients treated for mastoiditis during 1993-2007 at all Ear, Nose and Throat departments in Sweden were reviewed retrospectively according to defined criteria for acute mastoiditis. In this study the data from children aged 0-16 years were analyzed and compared 71/2 years before and 71/2 years after the introduction of the new guidelines in 2000. Results: A total of 577 cases aged 0-16 years fulfilled the inclusion criteria during the whole study period. Cases involving cholesteatoma were excluded. The number of children affected by acute mastoiditis did not increase after the introduction of new guidelines. Acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age. The proportion of acute mastoiditis increased after 2000 in the group aged 2-23 months although they were not affected concerning treatment by the new guidelines. No decrease was found in the frequency of prehospital antibiotic treatment among the children admitted with acute mastoiditis, and no increase was seen in the duration of ear symptoms before hospital admission, duration of hospital stay, or in the frequency of complications or mastoidectomies, after the introduction of the new guidelines in either group of children. Conclusions: The incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in Sweden did not increase following the introduction of new guidelines in 2000 for the diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media. This is despite the fact that a significant decrease in antibiotic prescriptions for otitis media has been reported during the same time period. The characteristics of acute mastoiditis reflecting severity of illness did not change over time. Acute mastoiditis was most common and increased after 2000 only in children younger than two years of age in which antibiotics were still recommended in all cases of acute otitis media. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-9), given in a 3-dose schedule, protected Gambian children against pneumococcal disease and reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci of vaccine serotypes. We have studied the effect of a booster or delayed primary dose of 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) on antibody and nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci 3-4 years after primary vaccination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recruited a subsample of children who had received 3 doses of either PCV-9 or placebo (controls) into this follow-up study. Pre- and post- PCV-7 pneumococcal antibody concentrations to the 9 serotypes in PCV-9 and nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci were determined before and at intervals up to 18 months post-PCV-7. We enrolled 282 children at a median age of 45 months (range, 38-52 months); 138 had received 3 doses of PCV-9 in infancy and 144 were controls. Before receiving PCV-7, a high proportion of children had antibody concentrations {\textgreater}0.35 µg/mL to most of the serotypes in PCV-9 (average of 75{\%} in the PCV-9 and 66{\%} in the control group respectively). The geometric mean antibody concentrations in the vaccinated group were significantly higher compared to controls for serotypes 6B, 14, and 23F. Antibody concentrations were significantly increased to serotypes in the PCV-7 vaccine both 6-8 weeks and 16-18 months after PCV-7. Antibodies to serotypes 6B, 9V and 23F were higher in the PCV-9 group than in the control group 6-8 weeks after PCV-7, but only the 6B difference was sustained at 16-18 months. There was no significant difference in nasopharyngeal carriage between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Pneumococcal antibody concentrations in Gambian children were high 34-48 months after a 3-dose primary infant vaccination series of PCV-9 for serotypes other than serotypes 1 and 18C, and were significantly higher than in control children for 3 of the 9 serotypes. Antibody concentrations increased after PCV-7 and remained raised for at least 18 months.},

abstract = {Traditional EPI vaccines are considered to be among the most efficient uses of scarce health care resources. Today, there are many under-used and new vaccines available. In the short- to medium-term, these vaccines will not cost the few cents per dose the traditional vaccines do, but will be 'multi-dollar' vaccines. Decision-makers will need information, among other things, on their relative cost-effectiveness. A number of reviews have indicated that there is scope for improving the transparency, completeness and comparability of economic evaluations of vaccination programmes. Thus, there is a need to improve the quality of economic evaluations of vaccination programmes. Adherence to general guidelines would increase the quality, interpretability and transferability of future analyses. However, there is reason to believe that there might also be a need for more specific advice for vaccination programmes. For example, there are inconsistencies in the methods used to estimate the future benefits of vaccination programmes and the relative efficiency of these programmes can be sensitive to some of the more controversial aspects of general guidelines, such as the inclusion of indirect costs and the discounting of health outcomes. This guide has been developed in order to meet the needs of decision-makers for relevant, reliable and consistent economic information. They aim to provide clear and concise, practical and high quality guidance for those who conduct economic evaluations.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is recommended for infants to protect against invasive disease, but its impact on otitis might also have public health importance. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of PCV on the incidence of otitis media, frequent otitis media and tympanostomy tube procedures and to assess whether the effectiveness of the vaccine wanes after age 24 months and varies by race, sex or season. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: From 1995 to 1998, 37 868 children at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California were randomized to receive PCV or a control vaccine in a double blind trial and were followed through April 1999. INTERVENTIONS: Children received a primary series at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and a booster at 12 to 15 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visits for otitis, frequent visits for otitis and tympanostomy tube procedures. Otitis was ascertained from diagnosis checklists routinely marked by physicians. RESULTS: Control children averaged 1.8 otitis visits per year. Children given PCV had fewer otitis visits than control children in every age group, sex, race and season examined. Intention-to-treat analysis permitted rejection of the null hypothesis that PCV is ineffective against otitis media (P {\textless} 0.0001). In children who completed the primary series per protocol, PCV reduced otitis visits by 7.8{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 5.4 to 10.2{\%}] and antibiotic prescriptions by 5.7{\%} (CI 4.2 to 7.2{\%}). Frequent otitis was reduced by amounts that increased with otitis frequency, from a 10{\%} reduction in the risk of 3 visits to a 26{\%} reduction in the risk of 10 visits within a 6-month period. Tube placements were reduced by 24{\%} (CI 12 to 35{\%}). CONCLUSION: In children followed up to 3.5 years, PCV provided a moderate amount of protection against ear infections while reducing frequent otitis media and tube procedures by greater amounts.},

abstract = {We revisited the three interrelated epidemiological concepts of effect modification, interaction and mediation for clinical investigators and examined their applicability when using research databases. The standard methods that are available to assess interaction, effect modification and mediation are explained and exemplified. For each concept, we first give a simple “best-case” example from a randomized controlled trial, followed by a structurally similar example from an observational study using research databases. Our explanation of the examples is based on recent theoretical developments and insights in the context of large health care databases. Terminology is sometimes ambiguous for what constitutes effect modification and interaction. The strong assumptions underlying the assessment of interaction, and par- ticularly mediation, require clinicians and epidemiologists to take extra care when conducting observational studies in the context of health care databases. These strong assumptions may limit the applicability of interaction and mediation assessments, at least until the biases and limitations of these assessments when using large research databases are clarified.},

abstract = {Ongoing surveillance for Streptococcus pneumoniae is needed to assess the impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduced in 2010 (PCV13). Forty-two U.S. centers submitted S. pneumoniae isolates between 1 October 2012 and 31 March 2013. Susceptibility testing was performed by use of a broth dilution method as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Serotyping was performed by multiplex PCR and the Quellung reaction. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as nonsusceptibility to penicillin (PNSP; MIC ≥ 0.12 $\mu$g/ml) combined with resistance to ≥2 non-$\beta$-lactam antimicrobials. Penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was defined as a penicillin MIC of ≥2 $\mu$g/ml. For the 1,498 isolates collected during 2012-13, the PRSP and MDR rates were 14.2 and 21.0{\%}, respectively. These percentages were lower than rates obtained in a surveillance study conducted 4 years earlier in 2008-09 (17.0 and 26.6{\%}, respectively). The most common serotypes identified in 2012-13 were 3, 35B, and 19A, each representing 9 to 10{\%} of all isolates. The largest percentage of PNSP in 2012-13 were found in serotypes 35B (24.8{\%}), 19A (23.5{\%}), and 15A (10.3{\%}). Predominant PRSP serotypes were 19A (54.5{\%}), 35B (28.2{\%}), and 19F (7.0{\%}). Major MDR serotypes were 19A (38.5{\%}), 15A (16.9{\%}), 6C (8.3{\%}), and 35B (6.4{\%}). The change in prevalence of PCV13 serotypes (43.4 to 27.1{\%}) was primarily due to a decrease in serotype 19A strains, i.e., 22{\%} of all strains in 2008-09 to 10{\%} of all strains in 2012-13. Among the PNSP subset, serotypes showing a proportional increase were 35B, 15B, and 23B. Among MDR strains, the largest proportional increases were observed in serotypes 35B, 15B, and 23A.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For the licensing of new pneumococcal vaccines, it is vital to be able to predict their protective efficacy on the basis of immunogenicity. However, the serological correlates of protection have not been established for pneumococcal diseases. METHODS: A total of 1666 children were immunized with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Acute otitis media (AOM) events were identified, and middle-ear fluid was cultured for pneumococci. The association between the concentration of antibodies against serotypes 6B, 19F, and 23F and the risk of AOM caused by the homologous serotypes or by the cross-reactive serotype 6A was assessed. An association model was used to predict efficacy at different geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). RESULTS: An association between antibody concentration and risk of AOM was found, but with large differences between serotypes. On the basis of the association, the predicted efficacy for 19F was negligible up to the highest GMC tested. In contrast, 6B was found to be highly efficacious ({\textgreater}65{\%}) at a GMC of 0.5 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results challenge the view that a new vaccine candidate should always induce antibody concentrations that are not inferior to those produced by the licensed vaccine. Furthermore, the differences between serotypes caution against defining a common correlate of protection that is applicable to all serotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7) have been used in children for more than a decade. Given the observed increase in disease caused by pneumococcal serotypes not covered by PCV7, an increasing number of countries are switching from 7-valent to 10- and 13-valent PCVs ("PCV10" and "PCV13"). Economic evaluations are important tools to inform decisions and price negotiations to make such a switch.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a critical assessment of economic evaluations involving PCV10 or PCV13, published since 2006.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We searched Scopus, ISI Web of Science (SCI and SSCI) and Pubmed to retrieve, select and review relevant studies, which were archived between 1st January 2006 and 31st January 2014. The review protocol involved standard extraction of assumptions, methods, results and sponsorships from the original studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sixty-three economic evaluations on PCVs published since January 2006 were identified. About half of these evaluated PCV10 and/or PCV13, the subject of this review. At current prices, both PCV13 and PCV10 were likely judged preferable to PCV7. However, the combined uncertainty related to price differences, burden of disease, vaccine effectiveness, herd and serotype replacement effects determine the preference base for either PCV10 or PCV13. The pivotal assumptions and results of these analyses also depended on which manufacturer sponsored the study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A more thorough exploration of uncertainty should be made in future analyses on this subject, as we lack understanding to adequately model herd and serotype replacement effects to reliably predict the population impact of PCVs. The introduction of further improved PCVs in an environment of evolving antibiotic resistance and under the continuing influence of previous PCVs implies that the complexity and data requirements for relevant analyses will further increase. Decision makers using these analyses should not just rely on an analysis from a single manufacturer.},

abstract = {Individuals {\textless}2 years and ≥50 years of age, as well as those with other specific risk factors, are especially vulnerable to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Conjugate vaccines have been developed against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae to provide improved immune responses. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has significantly reduced the burden of vaccine-type pneumococcal diseases in children, including invasive disease and pneumonia and acute otitis media. There have also been significant declines in antimicrobial resistance in 7-valent vaccine serotypes and carriage of S. pneumoniae in the post-PCV7 era. Two to three years after the introduction of PCV13, there is emerging, global evidence of a reduced burden of pneumococcal diseases in children, including declines in IPD (UK and Germany) and nasopharyngeal carriage of PCV13 serotypes (Portugal and France). The functional immunogenicity of PCV13 in individuals ≥50 years of age has been demonstrated in clinical trials in comparison with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and for children and adults 6 to 49 years of age. Between 2011 and 2013, PCV13 received market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for these additional age groups and is now available in Europe for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in all age groups.},

abstract = {Japan is now preparing to incorporate PCV-7 into the national childhood immunisation programme. Our recently published economic evaluation of using PCV-7 to the birth cohort suggests that the cost to gain one QALY is lower than the WHO's cost-effectiveness criterion for intervention. However, many countries have started to introduce PCV-13 into their national immunisation schedule replacing PCV-7 for preventing pneumococcal diseases among young children. These raise the need to appraise the 'value for money' of replacing PCV-7 with PCV-13 vaccination programme in Japan. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov model and calculated incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Our base-case analyses, which assumed both PCVs have no net indirect effect and set the cost of PCV-7/PCV-13 per shot at ¥10,000 (US{\$}125)/¥13,000 (US{\$}163). The results show that in Base-case A (assumed PCV-13 has no additional protection against AOM compared to PCV-7), replacing PCV-7 with PCV-13 will cost ¥37,722,901 (US{\$}471,536) or ¥35,584,455 (US{\$}444,850) per QALY when the caregiver's productivity loss is not included or is included, respectively. While in Base-case B (assumed PCV-13 has additional protection against AOM compared to PCV-7), ¥343,830 (US{\$}4298) per QALY or more QALY is gained by saving money without or with caregiver's productivity loss, respectively. We also find that, in Base-case B if cost per PCV-13 shot is equal to or less than that ¥17,000, then a PCV-13 vaccination programme offered to the birth cohort in Japan is likely to be a socially acceptable option compared to the current PCV-7 vaccination programme. Furthermore, if cost per PCV-13 shot is equal to or less than ¥12,000, replacing PCV-7 with PCV-13 will save money and gain more QALYs. While in Base-case A, the replacement can only be socially acceptable if cost per PCV-13 shot is equal to or less than ¥11,000.},

abstract = {The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), licensed in 2000, is highly efficient in preventing serious disease caused by serotypes in the vaccine and also prevents symptomless colonization of the nasopharynx. Prevention of this first step in the infection cycle has important consequences: it reduces chances of spread of the infection and indirectly protects from disease. Through these indirect effects, the protection afforded by the vaccine extends to the whole population, including those not vaccinated (herd immunity). Already now, after 5 years of wide use of PCV for infant immunization in the USA, more cases are prevented through the indirect effects than by vaccine-induced immunity in those vaccinated. The extended protection increases the cost-effectiveness of PCV and should clearly encourage its use in poorly resourced countries. However, the accumulated experience also shows that the herd immunity, due to PCV, is partly offset by replacement of the vaccine serotypes by other, nonvaccine serotypes. Owing to the general reduced virulence of the latter, this has only had a modest effect on disease, but the possibility of more virulent nonvaccine serotypes arising cannot be ignored and should be the focus of continued surveillance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ear infections are a common cause of illness during the first two years of life. New conjugate vaccines may be able to prevent a substantial portion of cases of acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: We enrolled 1662 infants in a randomized, double-blind efficacy trial of a heptavalent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine in which the carrier protein is the nontoxic diphtheria-toxin analogue CRM197. The children received either the study vaccine or a hepatitis B vaccine as a control at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. The clinical diagnosis of acute otitis media was based on predefined criteria, and the bacteriologic diagnosis was based on a culture of middle-ear fluid obtained by myringotomy. RESULTS: Of the children who were enrolled, 95.1 percent completed the trial. With the pneumococcal vaccine, there were more local reactions than with the hepatitis B vaccine but fewer than with the combined whole-cell diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine that was administered simultaneously. There were 2596 episodes of acute otitis media during the follow-up period between 6.5 and 24 months of age. The vaccine reduced the number of episodes of acute otitis media from any cause by 6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -4 to 16 percent [the negative number indicates a possible increase in the number of episodes]), culture-confirmed pneumococcal episodes by 34 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 45 percent), and the number of episodes due to the serotypes contained in the vaccine by 57 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 44 to 67 percent). The number of episodes attributed to serotypes that are cross-reactive with those in the vaccine was reduced by 51 percent, whereas the number of episodes due to all other serotypes increased by 33 percent. CONCLUSIONS: The heptavalent pneumococcal polysaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine is safe and efficacious in the prevention of acute otitis media caused by the serotypes included in the vaccine.},

abstract = {For estimating causal effects of treatments, randomized experiments are generally considered the gold standard. Nevertheless, they are often infeasible to conduct for a variety of reasons, such as ethical concerns, excessive expense, or timeliness. Consequently, much of our knowledge of causal effects must come from non-randomized observational studies. This article will advocate the position that observational studies can and should be designed to approximate randomized experiments as closely as possible. In particular, observational studies should be designed using only background information to create subgroups of similar treated and control units, where 'similar' here refers to their distributions of background variables. Of great importance, this activity should be conducted without any access to any outcome data, thereby assuring the objectivity of the design. In many situations, this objective creation of subgroups of similar treated and control units, which are balanced with respect to covariates, can be accomplished using propensity score methods. The theoretical perspective underlying this position will be presented followed by a particular application in the context of the US tobacco litigation. This application uses propensity score methods to create subgroups of treated units (male current smokers) and control units (male never smokers) who are at least as similar with respect to their distributions of observed background characteristics as if they had been randomized. The collection of these subgroups then 'approximate' a randomized block experiment with respect to the observed covariates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevention of otitis media, particularly among infants, remains a controversial issue. We evaluated the efficacy of insertion of tympanostomy tubes with and without adenoidectomy for preventing recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) in young children. METHODS: We randomly assigned 300 children aged 10 months to 2 years who had recurrent AOM to groups receiving tympanostomy tubes (Tymp) (n = 100), tympanostomy tubes with adenoidectomy (TympAde) (n = 100) or neither (Contr) (n = 100). All the children were followed up for 12 months. RESULTS: The primary outcome was intervention failure (2 AOM episodes in 2 months, 3 in 6 months or persistent effusion lasting for 2 months). Intervention failed in 21{\%} of cases (21/100) in the Tymp group, 16{\%} (16/100) in the TympAde group and 34{\%} (34/100) in the Contr group. The absolute differences were -13{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -25{\%} to -1{\%}, P = 0.04] between the Tymp and Contr groups and -18{\%} (95{\%} CI -30 to -6{\%}, P =0.004) between the TympAde and Contr groups. CONCLUSIONS: Insertion of tympanostomy tubes alone or with adenoidectomy was effective in preventing recurrent AOM episodes in children younger than 2 years of age.},

abstract = {Interventions designed to reduce antibiotic consumption are under way worldwide. While overall reductions are often achieved, their impact on the selection of antibiotic-resistant selection cannot be assessed accurately from currently available data. We developed a mathematical model of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) transmission inside and outside the hospital. A systematic simulation study was then conducted with two objectives: to assess the impact of antibiotic class-specific changes during an antibiotic reduction period and to investigate the interactions between antibiotic prescription changes in the hospital and the community. The model reproduced the overall reduction in MRSA frequency in French intensive-care units (ICUs) with antibiotic consumption in France from 2002 to 2003 as an input. However, the change in MRSA frequency depended on which antibiotic classes changed the most, with the same overall 10{\%} reduction in antibiotic use over 1 year leading to anywhere between a 69{\%} decrease and a 52{\%} increase in MRSA frequency in ICUs and anywhere between a 37{\%} decrease and a 46{\%} increase in the community. Furthermore, some combinations of antibiotic prescription changes in the hospital and the community could act in a synergistic or antagonistic way with regard to overall MRSA selection. This study shows that class-specific changes in antibiotic use, rather than overall reductions, need to be considered in order to properly anticipate the impact of an antibiotic reduction campaign. It also highlights the fact that optimal gains will be obtained by coordinating interventions in hospitals and in the community, since the effect of an intervention in a given setting may be strongly affected by exogenous factors.},

Incidence rates of the treatment in children aged 0-12 years were calculated using population estimates issued by the National Department of Statistics. RESULTS Whereas from 1990 to 1992 the total number of bilateral inserted tubes increased from 39.923 to 51.615, a decrease to 48.635 was observed in 1994. The average incidence rate of treatment with ventilation tubes was 1.97{\%} (range: 0.12{\%}-5.08{\%}) in children from birth to 12 years. Peak incidences were found around 2 years and 6 years of age. Prevalence rates of otitis media with effusion as found in the literature were higher, especially during infancy.},

abstract = {A survey of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia in the Grampian region of Scotland was carried out over a 2-year period. One hundred and four bacteraemic episodes were identified in 103 patients, an incidence of 9.8/100,000 population/year, and the mortality was 24{\%}. Clinical information was abstracted from 92 sets of patient notes and 98 isolates of S. pneumoniae were available for further study. The incidence of S. pneumoniae bacteraemia was highest at the extremes of age and peaked at 78 cases/100,000 population/year in those over 80 years old. Many patients had predisposing conditions, of which chronic lung disease (23{\%}), chronic alcohol abuse (10{\%}) and malignant disease (10{\%}) were the commonest. Age was the highest risk factor for mortality, with 20 of the 22 deaths in those over 65 years old. The commonest serotype of S. pneumoniae isolated was serotype 14 (23.5{\%}). Only one isolate (serotype 6A) showed intermediate resistance to penicillin, but 12 isolates (12.2{\%}) were resistant to erythromycin. Nine of these 12 isolates were of serotype 14 and had MICs clustered in the range 12-24 mg/L. Examination of all serotype 14 isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed the presence of two distinct genetic clusters, with all the erythromycin-resistant isolates in the same cluster. These isolates had similar PFGE profiles to erythromycin-resistant serotype 14 strains isolated elsewhere in the UK and they were positive for the mefE gene by PCR, confirming that resistance was of the M phenotype. The recent increase in erythromycin resistance in S. pneumoniae may be due, at least in part, to the spread of a serotype 14 clone of the M phenotype which appears to be an important cause of invasive disease.},

We built decision analysis models to evaluate a three-dose infant series of the 7-, 10- or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in 77 middle-income countries compared with no vaccination, accounting for direct protection of vaccinated children as well as herd protection and serotype replacement in unvaccinated children and adults. Over 10 years, pneumococcal vaccination would prevent at least 11.0 million cases and 314000 deaths in children under-5, one-third of the pneumonia and invasive disease cases and deaths that would occur in this age group without vaccination. Herd protection would prevent 3.1 million cases and 163000 deaths in older children and adults. A total of 11.1 million discounted disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) would be averted. At a dose cost of {\$}10 for lower- middle-income and {\$}20 for upper-middle-income countries, the net pooled (for all countries together) discounted vaccination cost would be {\$}18.1 billion ({\$}1600 per DALY averted).

In some regions, a strong causal relation links this pathogen with infections of the lower respiratory tract. In the past 20 years, a steady but constant increase has occurred in invasive NTHi worldwide, with perinatal infants, young children, and elderly people most at risk. Individuals with underlying comorbidities are most susceptible and infection is associated with high mortality. $\beta$-lactamase production is the predominant mechanism of resistance. However, the emergence and spread of $\beta$-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains in many regions of the world is of substantial concern, potentially necessitating changes to antibiotic treatment guidelines for community-acquired infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and potentially increasing morbidity associated with invasive NTHi infections. Standardised surveillance protocols and typing methodologies to monitor this emerging pathogen should be implemented. International scientific organisations need to raise the profile of NTHi and to document the pathobiology of this microbe.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading and serious coinfection in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, particularly in Africa. Prevention of this disease by vaccination with the current 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine is suboptimal. Protein conjugate vaccines offer a further option for protection, but data on their clinical efficacy in adults are needed. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical efficacy trial, we studied the efficacy of a 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in predominantly HIV-infected Malawian adolescents and adults who had recovered from documented invasive pneumococcal disease. Two doses of vaccine were given 4 weeks apart. The primary end point was a further episode of pneumococcal infection caused by vaccine serotypes or serotype 6A. RESULTS: From February 2003 through October 2007, we followed 496 patients (of whom 44{\%} were male and 88{\%} were HIV-seropositive) for 798 person-years of observation. There were 67 episodes of pneumococcal disease in 52 patients, all in the HIV-infected subgroup. In 24 patients, there were 19 episodes that were caused by vaccine serotypes and 5 episodes that were caused by the 6A serotype. Of these episodes, 5 occurred in the vaccine group and 19 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 74{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 30 to 90). There were 73 deaths from any cause in the vaccine group and 63 in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the vaccine group, 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 0.84 to 1.66). The number of serious adverse events within 14 days after vaccination was significantly lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (3 vs. 17, P=0.002), and the number of minor adverse events was significantly higher in the vaccine group (41 vs. 13, P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protected HIV-infected adults from recurrent pneumococcal infection caused by vaccine serotypes or serotype 6A.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Day care attendance is a major risk factor for respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses in preschool children. In this study, we describe the results of a hygiene intervention cohort trial at day care centres (DCCs) on the rates of febrile, respiratory, and gastrointestinal illnesses in preschool children. METHODS Thirty DCCs in 2 communities were included. The number of illness episodes was registered for each child every 6 months, as well as potential risk factors. The hygiene intervention was introduced in half of the DCCs and the results analysed using a multivariate mixed effects hierarchical Poisson regression model. RESULTS The study lasted 2.5 y, of which the hygiene intervention lasted 1.5 y. Two thousand three hundred and forty-nine children participated, delivering 2832 person-y. Adjusted incidence rate ratios of the illnesses at the intervention and non-intervention DCCs were not significantly different for any of the illnesses. The intervention was not more effective in children less than 3 y of age than in older children and no significant effects were seen with time. Compliance with the hygiene protocol was good as measured by the use of hygiene products and by a survey among the staff at the DCCs. CONCLUSIONS The most likely explanation for the lack of effects of the intervention is that the baseline standard of hygiene at the DCCs was probably too high for the intervention to demonstrate significant results, but recall bias cannot be excluded. Even though hygiene is important for minimizing the spread of microbes at DCCs, other risk factors need to be studied.},

abstract = {Objectives: To determine the microbiology of otitis media (OM) since the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in February 2010. Methods: Middle ear effusion from a pediatric Otolaryngology population undergoing pressure equalization tube (PET) placement was obtained and sent for aerobic culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing between August 2012 and April 2013. Vaccination records were obtained and statistical analysis was completed. Results: During the 8-month period, 236 ears were evaluated, and of those 39 ears were found to have positive cultures. The single nonvaccine Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 16) isolate was obtained from a PCV7-only vaccinated patient and was penicillin susceptible. The three most common isolates were Staphylococcus coagulase negative (57{\%}), Haemophilus influenzae (17{\%}), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7{\%}). Conclusions: This study is the first to assess the bacteriology of OM in a pediatric population undergoing PET placement in the immediate post-PCV13 era. Our study is limited by sample size; however, the lack of S. pneumoniae cultures indicates that PCV13 has had a significant impact on pneumococcal infections during these initial years following licensure. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Noncausal associations between exposures and outcomes are a threat to validity of causal inference in observational studies. Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments--the use of "negative controls"--is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

Few studies document pneumococcal household dynamics in the routine-PCV7 era.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We investigated age-specific acquisition, household introduction, carriage clearance, and intra-household transmission in a prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage in 300 American Indian households comprising 1,072 participants between March 2006 and March 2008.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Pneumococcal acquisition rates were 2-6 times higher in children than adults. More household introductions of new pneumococcal strains were attributable to children {\textless}9 years than adults ≥17 years (p{\textless}0.001), and older children (2-8 years) than younger children ({\textless}2 years) (p{\textless}0.008). Compared to children {\textless}2 years, carriage clearance was more rapid in older children (2-4 years, HRclearance 1.53 [95{\%} CI: 1.22, 1.91]; 5-8 years, HRclearance 1.71 [1.36, 2.15]) and adults (HRclearance 1.75 [1.16, 2.64]). Exposure to serotype-specific carriage in older children (2-8 years) most consistently increased the odds of subsequently acquiring that serotype for other household members.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In this community with a high burden of pneumococcal colonization and disease and routine PCV7 use, children (particularly older children 2-8 years) drive intra-household pneumococcal transmission: first, by acquiring, introducing, and harboring pneumococcus within the household, and then by transmitting acquired serotypes more efficiently than household members of other ages.},

abstract = {DILEMMA It has long been an axiom in clinical pediatrics that " children are not just little adults. " It has also been recognized that there are many changes from birth through childhood and the adolescent years. However, the full implications of pediatric age groupings for health care and research are still not adequately understood. There is still much to be discovered about children' s biological and psychological development and how these processes affect the effectiveness and efficacy of interventions. Trial design that accounts for age differences and promotes consistency in reporting of age-related data is essential to ensure the validity and clinical usefulness of pediatric trial data. A recent study highlighted variable treatment efficacy in children versus adults. In this study, 128 meta-analyses from Cochrane reviews, containing data on at least 1 adult and 1 pediatric randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a binary primary efficacy outcome, were reviewed. 1 The authors found that in all except 1 case, the 95{\%} confidence intervals could not exclude a relative difference in treatment efficacy between adults and children of .20{\%}; in two-thirds of these cases, the relative difference in observed point estimates was .50{\%}. The study also highlighted the paucity of RCTs in pediatrics; the median number of children per meta-analysis was 2.5 times smaller than the number of adults. Children and adults seem to have distinctive responses to treatments. For example, administration of phenobarbitones is useful for adults with cerebral malaria and is associated with decreased convulsions. However, in children, this drug is associated with increased 6-month mortality. Similarly, corticosteroids may offer survival benefit for adults with bac-terial meningitis but not for children with the same condition. In acute traumatic brain injury, corticosteroids did not decrease mortality in adults, but there was a trend for increased mortality in children. 1 In asthma, long-acting b2-agonists decreased exacerbations in adults but tended to increase exacerbations in children. 1 Intravenous lorazepam, when compared with diazepam in status epilepticus, led to significantly more discontinuations of status in adults but not in children. It is not surprising then that although using an algorithm for extrapolation of adult data for use in pediatric drug licensing and development was found to be useful for streamlining drug development and approvals for pe-diatric use, complete extrapolation from adult data were only appro-priate for 6{\%} of drugs reviewed. 2},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a serious infection in young infants. A heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in 2000 and recommended for all children aged 2 to 23 months. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in young infants before and after PCV7 was incorporated into the childhood immunization schedule in June 2000. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, population-based study of infants aged 0 to 90 days who resided in areas in 8 US states with active laboratory surveillance for invasive S pneumoniae infections from July 1, 1997, to June 30, 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of laboratory-confirmed IPD before (July 1, 1997-June 30, 2000) and after (July 1, 2001-June 30, 2004) PCV7 introduction, excluding a transition year (July 1, 2000-June 30, 2001). RESULTS: There were 146 cases of IPD, 89 before and 57 after PCV7 introduction. Isolated bacteremia occurred in 94 cases (64{\%}), pneumonia in 27 (18{\%}), meningitis in 22 (15{\%}), and septic arthritis and/or osteomyelitis in 3 (2{\%}). Mean rates of IPD for infants aged 0 to 90 days decreased 40{\%} from 11.8 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 9.6-14.5) to 7.2 (95{\%} CI, 5.6-9.4; P = .004) per 100 000 live births following PCV7 introduction. Among black infants, mean rates of IPD decreased significantly from 17.1 (95{\%} CI, 11.9-24.6) to 5.3 (95{\%} CI, 2.8-10.1; P = .001) per 100,000 live births, with a nonsignificant decrease from 9.6 (95{\%} CI, 7.3-12.7) to 6.8 (95{\%} CI, 4.9-9.4) per 100,000 live births for white infants. Rates of PCV7-serotype isolates decreased significantly from 7.3 (95{\%} CI, 5.3-10.1) to 2.4 (95{\%} CI, 1.6-3.8; P{\textless}.001) per 100,000 live births, while rates of non-PCV7 serotypes remained stable (P = .55). CONCLUSIONS: Since PCV7 introduction, rates of IPD in young infants have decreased significantly, providing evidence that vaccinating children aged 2 to 23 months has led to changes in pneumococcal carriage in infants too young to receive PCV7. With a significant decrease in rates of IPD among black infants, the previous racial difference has been eliminated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has decreased among both immunized children and nonimmunized adults since the licensure of a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) for use in infants in the United States in 2000. METHODS: Temporal trends in IPD incidence, clinical syndromes, and underlying conditions were analyzed using active laboratory- and population-based surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored Georgia Emerging Infections Program for the 20-county Metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, for the period of July 1997 through June 2004. P values were determined by test for trend. RESULTS: Since 2000, there have been significant decreases in the rates of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia (relative risk [RR], 0.80; P=.002) and meningitis (RR, 0.41; P=.003) in adults and for primary bacteremia, invasive pneumonia, and meningitis in children (RR, 0.16 [P{\textless}.001], 0.60 [P=.003], and 0.70 [P=.009], respectively). Among human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons, there were significant decreases in the overall rates of IPD (decrease of 43{\%}; P{\textless}.001) and invasive pneumonia (decrease of 44{\%}; P{\textless}.001) since 2000-2001, although the rate of IPD increased significantly (increase of 53{\%}; P=.022) among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. There was a concurrent increase in the proportion of adults aged {\textgreater} or = 40 years with underlying comorbidities. Rates of non-PCV7 serotypes increased 1.61-fold and 1.28-fold from 2000-2001 to 2003-2004 in children and adults (P=.005 for both). CONCLUSIONS: The decreasing incidence of IPD in Atlanta since 2000-2001 was associated with decreases in cases of pneumonia and meningitis in adult and pediatric subjects and in cases of primary bacteremia in children. The burden of serotype-replacement disease remained small. Adults with comorbidities represent a growing proportion of patients with IPD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) programme in England on serotype-specific carriage and invasive disease to help understand its role in serotype replacement and predict the impact of higher valency vaccines.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from children {\textless}5 y old and family members (n=400) 2 y after introduction of PCV7 into routine immunization programs. Proportions carrying Streptococcus pneumoniae and serotype distribution among carried isolates were compared with a similar population prior to PCV7 introduction. Serotype-specific case carrier ratios (CCRs) were estimated using national data on invasive disease. In vaccinated children and their contacts vaccine-type (VT) carriage decreased, but was offset by an increase in non-VT carriage, with no significant overall change in carriage prevalence, odds ratio 1.06 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.76-1.49). The lower CCRs of the replacing serotypes resulted in a net reduction in invasive disease in children. The additional serotypes covered by higher valency vaccines had low carriage but high disease prevalence. Serotype 11C emerged as predominant in carriage but caused no invasive disease whereas 8, 12F, and 22F emerged in disease but had very low carriage prevalence.

CONCLUSION: Because the additional serotypes included in PCV10/13 have high CCRs but low carriage prevalence, vaccinating against them is likely to significantly reduce invasive disease with less risk of serotype replacement. However, a few serotypes with high CCRs could mitigate the benefits of higher valency vaccines. Assessment of the effect of PCV on carriage as well as invasive disease should be part of enhanced surveillance activities for PCVs. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.},

abstract = {Background Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) is the most common illness in humans. Despite the high incidence, the economic impact of non–influenza-related VRTI has not been rigorously explored. Our objectives were to obtain an updated incidence of non–influenza-related VRTI in the United States and to quantify the health care resource use (direct costs) and productivity losses (indirect costs) associated with these infections. Methods A nationwide telephone survey of US households (N = 4051) was conducted between November 3, 2000, and February 12, 2001 to obtain a representative estimate of the self-reported incidence of non–influenza-related VRTI and related treatment patterns. Direct treatment costs measured included outpatient clinician encounters, use of over-the-counter and prescription drugs, and associated infectious complications of non–influenza-related VRTI. Absenteeism estimates for infected individuals and parents of infected children were extrapolated from National Health Interview Survey data. Results Of survey respondents, 72{\%} reported a non–influenza-related VRTI within the past year. Respondents who experienced a self-reported non–influenza-related VRTI averaged 2.5 episodes annually. When these rates are extrapolated to the entire US population, approximately 500 million non–influenza-related VRTI episodes occur per year. Similarly, if the treatment patterns reported by the respondents are extended to the population, the total economic impact of non–influenza-related VRTI approaches {\$}40 billion annually (direct costs, {\$}17 billion per year; and indirect costs, {\$}22.5 billion per year). Conclusions Largely because of the high attack rate, non–influenza-related VRTI imposes a greater economic burden than many other clinical conditions. The pending availability of effective antiviral therapies warrants increased attention be paid to this common and expensive illness.},

All children had received at least 2 doses of PCV13. The S. pneumoniae isolates were subjected to serotyping and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. We compared the findings with results obtained in 3 earlier studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae in 113 (50{\%}) of the children with AOM. PCV7 and PCV13 serotypes accounted for 2{\%} and 12{\%}, respectively, of the pneumococcal isolates. Of the 14 PCV13 isolates, 8 were serotype 19A. Nonvaccine serotypes accounted for 69{\%} of the isolates. Most frequently occurring were subtypes of serotype 15 (23{\%}) and serotype 35B (9{\%}). Overall, 33{\%} of the isolates were penicillin nonsusceptible, a proportion not significantly different from proportions found in our 3 earlier studies (26{\%}, 36{\%} and 37{\%}, respectively). Serotypes 15 and 35B accounted for 51{\%} of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Expansion of contents of pneumococcal vaccine administered to children is followed by not-fully-predictable changes in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization. Continued surveillance is required to help inform future vaccine development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media (AOM) is an important cause of childhood morbidity and antibiotic prescriptions. However, the relative importance of the well-known otopathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hflu), remains unclear because of a limited number of tympanocentesis-based studies that vary significantly in populations sampled, case definitions and heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use. METHODS We conducted a pooled analysis of results from 10 AOM etiology studies of similar design, the protocols of which were derived from a common protocol and conducted in children 3 months to 5 years of age in different countries. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for within-study correlations. RESULTS The majority, 55.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 47.0{\%}-65.7{\%}) of 1124 AOM episodes, were bacterial pathogen positive: 29.1{\%} (24.8{\%}-34.1{\%}) yielded Hflu and 23.6{\%} (19.0{\%}-29.2{\%}) Spn. Proportions of Hflu and Spn were higher and lower, respectively, in heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-vaccinated children. Hflu and Spn were each isolated from 20{\%} to 35{\%} of children in every 1-year age range. Hflu was less likely to be isolated from first (vs. subsequent) episodes [relative risk (RR): 0.71 (0.60-0.84)]. Spn was more often isolated from sporadic (vs. recurrent) cases [RR: 0.76 (0.61-0.97)]; the opposite was true for Hflu [RR: 1.4 (1.00-1.96)]. Spn cases were more likely to present with severe (vs. mild) symptoms [RR: 1.42 (1.01-2.01)] and Hflu cases with severe tympanic membrane inflammation [RR: 1.35 (1.06-1.71)]. CONCLUSIONS Spn and Hflu remain the leading otopathogens in all populations examined. While associated with overlapping symptoms and severity, they exhibit some differences in their likelihood to cause disease in specific subpopulations.},

In addition, we asked each child's parent/guardian about antibiotic use {\textless}90 days before study enrollment, including antibiotics received elsewhere other than the study clinic. Each child's medical record was reviewed to identify any PCN (including amoxicillin) or TMP– SMX use {\textless}90 days before study enrollment (e, recent antibiotic use) and to determine the dates of previous PCV7 vaccine doses. A sterile calcium–alginate tipped swab (Calgiswab type 1; Har-wood Products; 2000–2004) or nylon fiber flocked swab (Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA; 2008–2010) was inserted through the nose into the posterior nasopharynx of each child and immediately plated onto a gentamicin-blood agar medium (2000–2004) or media containing skim milk–tryptone–glucose–glycerol (2008–2010) for transportation to our laboratory. 19,20 S. pneumoniae were identified in the laboratory by bile solu-bility and optochin sensitivity when plated on gentamicin-blood agar medium. 21 Pneumococcal serotype was determined by latex agglutination and the Quellung reaction. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of pneumococcal isolates to PCN and TMP– SMX was determined by Etest (bioM{\'{e}}rieux Clinical Diagnostics). Isolates were classified as susceptible to PCN (PCN-S) if MICs ≤0.064 mcg/mL, resistant to PCN (PCN-R) if MICs {\textgreater}1 mcg/mL and intermediate susceptibility to PCN (PCN-I) if MICs {\textgreater}0.064– ≤1 mcg/mL. 22 Isolates sensitivity to TMP–SMX was determined by their sensitivity to TMP and were classified as susceptible to TMP–SMX (TS-S) if MICs {\textless}1 mcg/mL, resistant to TMP–SMX (TS-R) if MICs {\textgreater}4 mcg/mL and intermediate susceptibility to TMP–SMX (TS-I) if MICs = 1‒4 mcg/mL.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in 2000. The first 7-valent vaccine was followed by a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) with the same conjugate, and a 10-valent vaccine (PCV10), conjugated to protein D from H. influenzae. The vaccines offer some protection against pneumococcal acute otitis media (AOM), and, with PCV10, possibly also some protection against H. influenzae AOM. PCV7 was introduced in Sweden in 2009, but from 2010, Swedish counties were free to use either PCV13 or PCV10. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of AOM-related diagnoses and surgical procedures before and after the introduction of PCV in Sweden, but also to compare the areas using PCV13 and PCV10. METHODS Data showing the number of AOM diagnoses, ventilation tube insertions, myringotomies, acute mastoiditis cases and mastoidectomies between 2005 and 2014 were extracted from the National Board of Health and Welfare database. Yearly national incidences were calculated, and areas using PCV13 and PCV10 were compared. RESULTS AOM incidence decreased, both in out-patients (39{\%}) and hospital admissions (42{\%}). Ventilation tube insertions decreased by 18{\%}, and myringotomies by 15{\%}. The decline in out-patient AOM and ventilation tube insertions was more pronounced in areas that used PCV10, but geographical differences were large also before vaccine introduction. CONCLUSION Otitis media-related diagnoses have decreased in Sweden since the introduction of PCV. Though some decreases were more pronounced in areas where PCV10 were used, figures should be interpreted with great caution, since considerable geographical differences were obvious also before vaccine introduction.},

OBJECTIVE To measure small-area variations in rates of myringotomy with insertion of tympanostomy tubes (TTs) and to identify determinants of rate variation. DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective analyses using hospital discharge data for patients who had undergone a myringotomy with insertion of TT by county in Ontario between April 1, 1996, and March 31, 1999. Information on possible determinants was taken from a survey of otolaryngologists and primary care physicians in 1996 and from the 1996 Canadian census and physician demographic databases for 1996-1999. PARTICIPANTS A total of 75 358 hospitalizations for TT placement of children and adolescents (aged {\textless}/=14 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Small-area variation in rates of TT. RESULTS An almost 10-fold difference between the areas with the highest and lowest rates was found (extremal quotient, 9.6; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 8.2-11.1; P{\textless}.001). Higher rates occurred in counties with higher percentages of high school graduates (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95{\%} CI, 0-0.02; P =.049); and where referring physicians were more likely to be male (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95{\%} CI, 0-0.02; P =.01), North American-trained (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.01-0.02; P{\textless}.001), and have higher propensities to refer for surgery (parameter estimate, 0.40; 95{\%} CI, 0.09-0.72; P =.02). Otolaryngologist opinion was not a significant predictor. CONCLUSION Substantial area variation in TT rates was observed. The opinion of primary care physicians was the dominant modifiable determinant, suggesting an area of research that may be important in reducing area variation in TT procedures.},

The vaccines varied by serotypes covered and included a 7- (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F), 10- (1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) and 13-valent (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) vaccines. The base case was PCV-7, and clinical and economic outcomes were estimated for the vaccinated persons and for other persons through assumptions about a herd effect. By comparison, clinical and economic outcomes for the population were also estimated for the 10 and 13 serotype vaccines. Results: In the base case (PCV-7), with the seven serotype vaccine, there were 9.38 cases of hospitalized pneumonia, 0.22 cases of meningitis, 3.69 cases of bacteremia, 60.19 cases of otitis media, and 373 cases of pneumonia, per 100,000 persons in the population, at all ages. With the 10-valent vaccine and a herd effect, invasive pneumonia fell to 8.71 cases, meningitis to 0.21 cases, and bacteremia to 3.39 cases. Otitis media fell to 57 cases and pneumonia to 344 cases. There were further reductions with the 13-valent vaccine, with invasive pneumonia falling to 8.37 cases, bacteremia to 3.33 cases, otitis media to 51.9 cases and all-cause pneumonia to 336.2 cases. Among the vaccines evaluated, PCV-13 was associated with the lowest health services costs and the greatest improved health outcomes. Conclusions: Increased serotype coverage of the 13-valent vaccine is expected to have a substantial public health and economic impact on infectious disease, when considering direct and indirect effects. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background Data on more than a decade of outpatient quinolone use were collected from 33 European countries within the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) project, funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).Methods For the period 1997{\^{a}}€“2009, data on outpatient use of systemic quinolones aggregated at the level of the active substance were collected using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)/defined daily dose (DDD) method (WHO, version 2011), and expressed in DDD and packages per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID and PID, respectively). Using a classification based on pharmacokinetic and in vitro potency profiles, quinolone use was analysed with regard to trends over time, seasonal variation and composition.Results Total outpatient quinolone use in 2009 varied by a factor of 7.5 between the country with the highest (Italy, 3.61 DID) and the country with the lowest (the UK, 0.48 DID) quinolone use. The second-generation quinolones accounted for {\textgreater}50{\%} of quinolone use (mainly ciprofloxacin), except for Croatia, where first-generation quinolones (mainly norfloxacin) were mostly used. A significant increase in outpatient quinolone use was found for Europe, as well as a large seasonal variation, which increased significantly over time from 1997 to 2009. Relative use of third-generation quinolones significantly increased over time with respect to the use of second-generation quinolones, while the relative use of both significantly increased with respect to the first-generation quinolones. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (respiratory quinolones) represented {\textgreater}10{\%} of quinolone outpatient use in 17 countries, with extreme seasonal variation in all countries.Conclusions There was a substantial increase and change in the pattern of quinolone use between 1997 and 2009, a period during which quinolones that are effective for the treatment of respiratory tract infections were introduced. These quinolones are not the first-line antibiotics for this indication and their use should generally be limited, and quinolones should ideally show no substantial seasonal variation in terms of their use.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Static pharmacoeconomic models have been used to conduct pharmacoeconomic analyses of pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programs. The objective of this study was to develop a transmission dynamic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Taiwan. METHODS: An age-structured transmission dynamic model was populated with parameters from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database and publicly available sources to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of PCV13. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore model uncertainties. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, four-dose scheduled universal infant PCV13 vaccination will prevent 5112 cases of invasive pneumococcal diseases, 535,607 cases of all-cause hospitalized pneumonia, 726,986 cases of acute otitis media, and 420 deaths over a 10-year time horizon since 2009. The four-dose vaccination program is estimated to yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US{\$}38,045 and US{\$}18,299 from payer and societal perspectives. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is most sensitive to vaccine price. The 95{\%} confidence interval of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US{\$}10,186 to US{\$}34,563 by multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses in the societal perspective. CONCLUSIONS: With a World Health Organization-recommended cost-effectiveness threshold, the PCV13 vaccination program would be cost-effective in Taiwan. To circumvent the lack of long-term real data, a transmission dynamic model is informative to decision makers on evaluating the long-term cost-effectiveness of PCV13.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined relationships between otitis media risk factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and maternal knowledge and attitudes and early onset of otitis media. METHODS: Pregnant women from Minnesota American Indian reservations and an urban clinic were enrolled in our study between 1998 and 2001. Follow-up was performed on enrollees' infants until the children were 2 years old. Research nurses collected data by ear examination, from interviews and questionnaires given to enrolled mothers, and otitis media episodes that were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of infants had experienced an otitis media episode by 6 months of age. Logistic regression analyses showed that maternal otitis media history, infant history of upper respiratory infection, and compliance with study visits were significantly related to early otitis media onset. Although high percentages of infants were exposed to cigarette smoke and other children and were formula fed, these factors were not related to otitis media. Mothers' prenatal awareness of otitis media risks associated with environmental tobacco smoke exposure and formula feeding did not predict their postpartum behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: We found that infant history of upper respiratory infection and maternal otitis media history are risk factors for early otitis media in American Indian infants. Mothers' prepartum knowledge and attitudes regarding otitis media did not predict their postpartum avoidance of risk behaviors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) had profound public-health impacts and is considered cost-effective and potentially cost saving. Two new PCVs have been launched, a 10-valent vaccine (PCV10) and a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13). We examined public-health and economic impacts of PCV pediatric national immunization programs (NIPs) in Germany, Greece, and the Netherlands. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the impact of PCV13, PCV7, and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia (PNE), and acute otitis media (AOM). Using epidemiological data, we calculated the cases of IPD, PNE, and AOM, using country-specific incidence, serotype coverage, disease sequelae, mortality, vaccine effectiveness, indirect effects, costs, and utilities. Direct effects for PCV13- and PCV10-covered serotypes were assumed similar to PCV7. PCV13 was assumed to confer an indirect effect, while PCV10 was not. Assumptions were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In a NIP, PCV13 was estimated to eliminate 31.7{\%}, 46.4{\%}, and 33.8{\%} of IPD in Germany, Greece, and the Netherlands, respectively. Compared with PCV7 and PCV10, PCV13 was found to be cost-effective or cost saving in all cases when PCV13 indirect effects were included. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric NIPs with PCV13 in Europe are expected to have dramatic public-health impacts and be cost-effective or cost saving.},

abstract = {Background In 2007, ESAC (http://www.esac.ua.ac.be) published a set of 12 valid drug-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic use in Europe. In this study, the authors aimed to develop evidence-based disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing in Europe. Methods Two meetings were convened to produce a list of disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing which conform to internationally agreed recommendations, building on a similar development of drug-specific quality indicators, and in collaboration with CHAMP and HAPPY AUDIT. 62 experts were asked to complete two scoring rounds of the proposed indicators on seven dimensions: their relevance to (1) reducing antimicrobial resistance, (2) patient health benefit, (3) cost-effectiveness, (4) policy makers, (5) individual prescribers, (6) their evidence base and (7) their range of acceptable use, using a scale ranging from 1 (=completely disagree) to 9 (=completely agree). Scores were judged according to the UCLA-RAND appropriateness method. Results For the six main indications for antibiotic prescribing (acute otitis media, acute upper-respiratory infection, acute/chronic sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis, cystitis/other urinary infection) and for pneumonia, three quality indicators were proposed, the percentage prescribed (a) antibiotics; (b) recommended antibiotics; (c) quinolones. This set was scored by 40 experts from 25 countries. After one scoring round, all indicators were already rated as relevant on all dimensions, except one. Conclusion All proposed disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing have face validity and are potentially applicable. They could be used to better describe antibiotic use and assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing patterns in ambulatory care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incidence and severity of respiratory infections are increased in day-care center attendees. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important contributor to these infections. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine could reduce the occurrence of respiratory infections and the ensuing antibiotic drug use in the day care. METHOD: In this double blind, randomized, controlled study performed in 8 day-care centers located in Beer-Sheva, Israel, 264 toddlers ages 12 to 35 months at enrollment were randomized to receive either a 9-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (conjugated to CRM197) or a control vaccine [conjugate meningococcus C vaccine (conjugated to CRM197)] and were followed for an average of 22 months. The main outcome measures were respiratory morbidity and antibiotic use. RESULTS: An overall reduction of 7{\%} in child months with {\textgreater} or = 1 reported illness episodes was observed among vaccinees (P = 0.008), and 85{\%} of all episodes were related to the respiratory tract. Reductions of 15, 16 and 17{\%} were observed in upper respiratory infections, lower respiratory problems and otitis media, respectively. An overall reduction of 17{\%} in antibiotic days was observed [10{\%} for upper respiratory infections, 20{\%} for otitis and 47{\%} for lower respiratory problems (P {\textless} or = 0.005 for each entity)]. The reduction in episodes and antibiotic use was greater for those {\textless}36 months of age than for the older children. CONCLUSION: The reduction of respiratory problems, including those not traditionally considered of pneumococcal origin and the ensuing lowered antibiotic use in day-care center attendees by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination suggest a broader benefit from the vaccine than preventing invasive disease only.},

Children account for a high proportion of antibiotics prescribed in primary care.Aim To determine the predictors of antibiotic prescription in young children presenting to UK general practices with acute illness.Design and setting Prospective observational study in general practices in Wales.Method A total of 999 children were recruited from 13 practices between March 2008 and July 2010. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of antibiotic prescribing.Results Oral antibiotics were prescribed to 261 children (26.1{\%}). Respiratory infections were responsible for 77.4{\%} of antibiotic prescriptions. The multivariable model included 719 children. Children were more likely to be prescribed antibiotics if they were older (odds ratio [OR] 1.3; 95{\%} confidence intervals [CI] = 1.1 to 1.7); presented with poor sleep (OR 2.7; 95{\%} CI = 1.5 to 5.0); had abnormal ear (OR 6.5; 95{\%} CI = 2.5 to 17.2), throat (OR 2.2; 95{\%} CI = 1.1 to 4.5) or chest examination (OR 13.6; 95{\%} CI = 5.8 to 32.2); were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (OR 9.5; 95{\%} CI = 3.7 to 25.5), tonsillitis/sore throat (OR 119.3; 95{\%} CI = 28.2 to 504.6), ear infection (OR 26.5; 95{\%} CI = 7.4 to 95.7) or urinary tract infection (OR 12.7; 95{\%} CI = 4.4 to 36.5); or if the responsible clinician perceived the child to be moderately to severely unwell (OR 4.0; 95{\%} CI = 1.4 to 11.4). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9371.Conclusion Respiratory infections were responsible for 74.4{\%} of antibiotic prescriptions. Diagnoses of tonsillitis, sore throat, or ear infection were associated most with antibiotic prescribing. Diagnosis seemed to be more important than abnormal examination findings in predicting antibiotic prescribing, although these were correlated.},

The aim of the present study was to compare the cost effectiveness of treatment with amoxicillin versus a watch-and-wait approach (WAIT) within a Canadian pediatric setting. Four hundred eighty-eight children, six months to five years of age, who participated in a randomized controlled trial were included in the study. The average medication costs per patient were higher for the amoxicillin group ({\$}17.26) than for the WAIT group ({\$}4.33). However, both health care ({\$}148.44 versus {\$}162.48) and patient costs ({\$}23.50 versus {\$}31.87) were greater for the WAIT group. The mean cost of treatment for the amoxicillin group was {\$}189.20, compared with {\$}198.68 for the WAIT group. Amoxicillin may be cost effective in treating children with acute otitis media. The potential development of antimicrobial resistance was not addressed in the present study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children. We evaluated the efficacy of a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a randomized, double-blind study in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: At 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, 19,922 children received the 9-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine conjugated to a noncatalytic cross-reacting mutant of diphtheria toxin (CRM197), and 19,914 received placebo. All children received Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine. Efficacy and safety were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Among children without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the vaccine reduced the incidence of a first episode of invasive pneumococcal disease due to serotypes included in the vaccine by 83 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 97; 17 cases among controls and 3 among vaccine recipients). Among HIV-infected children, the efficacy was 65 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 24 to 86; 26 and 9 cases, respectively). Among children without HIV infection, the vaccine reduced the incidence of first episodes of radiologically confirmed alveolar consolidation by 20 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 35; 212 cases in the control group and 169 in the vaccinated group) in the intention-to-treat analysis and by 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 41; 158 and 119 cases, respectively) in the per-protocol analysis (i.e., among fully vaccinated children). The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by penicillin-resistant strains was reduced by 67 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 88; 21 cases in the control group and 7 in the vaccinated group), and that caused by strains resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was reduced by 56 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 16 to 78; 32 and 14 cases, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reduced the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia. The vaccine also reduced the incidence of vaccine-serotype and antibiotic-resistant invasive pneumococcal disease among children with and those without HIV infection.},

There have been conflicting reports as to whether protection against carriage is serotype specific and which immune mechanisms drive carriage. Analyzing longitudinal carriage data from Israeli toddlers in day care, we found a lower risk of colonization with types 6A, 14, and 23F after previous exposure to the homologous type. Nonsignificant trends suggesting possible protection derived from prior exposure were found for types 19A and 23A. Furthermore, we found that, for types 14 and 23F, this specific protection correlated with increased serotype-specific antibody concentration. We found no evidence of specific protection for type 6B, group 15, or type 19F. Our findings imply that at least some serotypes generate anti-capsular antibodies that can reduce the risk of carriage in unimmunized toddlers.},

The aim of this review is to present all cases of medialized tympanostomy tubes reported in the literature in order to provide the most beneficial management option. Methods: Eligible articles were identified through a comprehensive search in Cochrane, Embase and Medline electronic databases. Two reviewers independently screened the data sources, using pre-defined inclusion criteria to generate a list of eligible articles. Data extracted included patient demographics, diagnosis, type of tube, timing of migration, presenting symptoms, examination outcomes, treatment and follow up. Results: 10 articles were chosen for data extraction from which 29 patients presenting with medial migration of tympanostomy tube were identified. Conclusion: The low complications associated with removing a medialized tube and the risk of leaving foreign objects in the middle ear cleft make myringotomy for removal of the tube a practical and safe management option for medialized tubes even in asymptomatic patients.},

abstract = {The gene encoding the pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) protein, psaA, was confirmed in all Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes by a newly developed PCR (psaA PCR) assay. Eighty-nine of the 90 serotypes amplified produced an 838-bp fragment; the exception was a serotype 16F strain acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Analysis of 20 additional 16F strains from the United States and Brazil showed that the gene was amplified in all 16F strains, implying that the serotype 16F ATCC strain must be a variant. The specificity of the assay was verified by the lack of signal from analysis of heterologous bacterial species (n = 30) and genera (n = 14), including viridans group streptococci. The potential of the assay for clinical application was shown by its ability to detect pneumococci in culture-positive nasopharyngeal specimens. Demonstration of psaA in all 90 serotypes and lack of amplification of heterologous organisms suggest that this assay could be a useful tool for detection of pneumococci and diagnosis of disease.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Pneumococcal infections are the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in children. In June 2015, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in the Portuguese Immunization Program. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of children vaccination with PCV13 versus no vaccination for preventing pneumococcal diseases (PD). METHOD A cohort simulation model for 2014 Portuguese newborns was used, considering a lifetime horizon and existence of herd effect on adults. Model outcomes measured life years gained (LYG), direct and indirect healthcare costs and net benefits considering {\&}OV0556;20,000 per LYG. PCV13 clinical effectiveness rate by serotype covered was assumed similar to PCV7. Patients' resource use was based on 2014 diagnostic-related-group database and experts' opinion, while national legislation and official drug cost database were the main sources for unitary costs. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess results' effectiveness. RESULTS In base case scenario, PCV13 was a dominant strategy, being associated with better health outcomes and lower costs. In a lifetime, a total of 6,238 infections (excluding AOM) and 130 deaths were averted, with a total saving of {\&}OV0556;397,217 (USD {\$}432,966). Net benefits were estimated above {\&}OV0556;28M (USD {\$}30M.) Results were robust in all sensitivity analyses, with positive net benefits, except when herd effect was excluded. CONCLUSION Vaccination of children with PCV13 starting in their first year of life is a cost-effective intervention with the potential to save costs to the Portuguese health system and to provide health gains by reducing the burden of pneumococcal disease in the vaccinees and through the herd effect of this vaccine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Several Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries have introduced pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-10 or PCV-13) in their routine national immunization programs. OBJECTIVES We aimed to summarize the evidence of PCV impact and effectiveness in children under 5 years old in the LAC Region. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the literature on impact or effectiveness of PCVs on deaths or hospitalizations due to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. We searched Medline, WoS, Lilacs, Scopus, Central and gray literature published in any language from 2009 to January 2016. We included studies addressing the outcomes of interest in children in the target age group, and with the following designs: randomized trials, cohort or case-control, interrupted time series with at least three data points before and after the intervention, and before-after studies. Screening of citations, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted in duplicate by independent reviewers, according to the study protocol registered on PROSPERO. Descriptive analysis of the effectiveness measurements and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Effectiveness is reported as 1-OR or 1-RR for case control or cohort/clinical trials, and as percent change of disease incidence rates for before-after studies. RESULTS We identified 1,085 citations, 892 from databases and 193 from other sources. Of these, 22 were further analyzed. Studies were from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Peru and Nicaragua. Effectiveness ranged from 8.8-37.8{\%} for hospitalizations due to X-ray confirmed pneumonia, 7.4-20.6{\%} for clinical pneumonia, and 13.3-87.7{\%} for meningitis hospitalizations, and 56-83.3{\%} for IPD hospitalization, varying by age, outcome definition, type of vaccine and study design. CONCLUSIONS Available evidence to date indicates significant impact of both PCV-10 and PCV-13 in the outcomes studied, with no evidence of the superiority of one vaccine over the other on pneumonia, IPD or meningitis hospitalization reduction in children under 5 years old.},

Using Medicare administrative, we found that the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) hospitalizations in the elderly in the 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, were 22.6, 30.2, and 40.6{\%} lower, respectively, than during the baseline period, 1996-1997 through 1999-2000 (range 35.1/100,000 to 38.3/100,000). Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has been recommended for the elderly, since 1989. PPV23 vaccination rates in the elderly increased by 25.2{\%} during the baseline period but by {\textless}5{\%} during the period PCV7 has been available. Thus, during the period that PCV7 vaccine has been used in children, rates of IPD in the elderly have declined appreciably more compared to the immediately prior period when PPV23 was the only vaccine available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In randomized controlled trials and postmarketing studies the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) has been shown to reduce myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion (MVTI) procedures in a 4-dose schedule. In Australia, a 3-dose schedule at 2, 4, and 6 months of age is routinely used in non-Indigenous children. Our aim was to determine if a reduction in MVTI comparable to that documented in the United States occurred in Australia despite the absence of the booster dose.

METHODS: All episodes of MVTI in Australia from July 1998 to June 2007 among children aged {\textless}or=9 years were identified in an electronic database of national hospitalization records, including the public and private sectors. Age-stratified rates of MVTI before and after introduction of 7vPCV into the national immunization program in 2005 were determined, with Poisson regression modeling used to determine the vaccine impact after adjusting for background and seasonal trends.

RESULTS: A total of 238,634 hospital separations were identified. In the 2.5 years after routine 7vPCV introduction, there was a significant adjusted reduction in MVTI in children aged {\textless}1, 1, and 2 years of 23{\%}, 16{\%}, and 6{\%}, respectively. A nonsignificant reduction was observed in those aged 3 and 4 years, while a significant increase of 5{\%} was observed for the 5- to 9-year age group.

CONCLUSIONS: Although ecologic data such as this have limitations, the significant differential effects observed by time period and age group are suggestive of a vaccine effect of similar magnitude to that documented by postmarketing surveillance in the United States. The rapid uptake of 7vPCV in Australia, including catch up to 2 years of age, is an important difference to the United States and it is possible that an even greater effect would have been observed with a booster dose in the second year of life. Longer term data will be needed to fully assess the role of a booster dose.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been in routine use in the United States for 5 years. Prior U.S. cost-effectiveness analyses have not taken into account the effect of the vaccine on nonvaccinated persons. METHODS: We revised a previously published model to simulate the effects of PCV on children vaccinated between 2000 and 2004, and to incorporate the effect of the vaccine in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in nonvaccinated persons during those years. Data from the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2000-2004) were used to estimate changes in the burden of IPD in nonvaccinated adults since the introduction of PCV (compared with the baseline years 1997-1999). Results combined the simulated effects of the vaccine on the vaccinated and nonvaccinated populations. RESULTS: Before incorporating herd effects in the model, the PCV was estimated to have averted 38,000 cases of IPD during its first 5 years of use at a cost of dollar 112,000 per life-year saved. After incorporating the reductions in IPD for nonvaccinated individuals, the vaccine averted 109,000 cases of IPD at a cost of dollar 7500 per life-year saved. When the herd effect was assumed to be half that of the base case, the cost per life-year saved was dollar 18,000. CONCLUSIONS: IPD herd effects in the nonvaccinated population substantially reduce the cost, and substantially improve the cost-effectiveness, of PCV. The cost-effectiveness of PCV in actual use has been more favorable than predicted by estimates created before the vaccine was licensed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation, resolution of symptoms, processes of care, and outcomes of pneumococcal pneumonia, and to compare features of the bacteremic and nonbacteremic forms of this illness. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Five medical institutions in 3 geographic locations. PARTICIPANTS: Inpatients and outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic characteristics, respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms, and physical examination findings were obtained from interviews or chart review. Severity of illness was assessed using a validated prediction rule for short-term mortality in CAP. Pneumococcal pneumonia was categorized as bacteremic; nonbacteremic, pure etiology; or nonbacteremic, mixed etiology. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight (6.9{\%}) of 2,287 patients (944 outpatients, 1,343 inpatients) with CAP had pneumococcal pneumonia. Sixty-five (41{\%}) of the 158 with pneumococcal pneumonia were bacteremic; 74 (47{\%}) were nonbacteremic with S. pneumoniae as sole pathogen; and 19 (12{\%}) were nonbacteremic with S. pneumoniae as one of multiple pathogens. The pneumococcal bacteremia rate for outpatients was 2.6{\%} and for inpatients it was 6.6{\%}. Cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic pain were common respiratory symptoms. Hemoptysis occurred in 16{\%} to 22{\%} of the patients. A large number of nonrespiratory symptoms were noted. Bacteremic patients were less likely than nonbacteremic patients to have sputum production and myalgias (60{\%} vs 82{\%} and 33{\%} vs 57{\%}, respectively; P {\textless}.01 for both), more likely to have elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, and more likely to receive penicillin therapy. Half of bacteremic patients were in the low risk category for short-term mortality (groups I to III), similar to the nonbacteremic patients. None of the 32 bacteremic patients in risk groups I to III died, while 7 of 23 (30{\%}) in risk group V died. Intensive care unit admissions and pneumonia-related mortality were similar between bacteremic and nonbacteremic groups, although 46{\%} of the bacteremic group had respiratory failure compared with 32{\%} and 37{\%} for the other groups. The nonbacteremic pure etiology patients returned to household activities faster than bacteremic patients. Symptoms frequently persisted at 30 days: cough (50{\%}); dyspnea (53{\%}); sputum production (48{\%}); pleuritic pain (13{\%}); and fatigue (63{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: There were few differences in the presentation of bacteremic and nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. About half of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia patients were at low risk for mortality. Symptom resolution frequently was slow.},

abstract = {Once a vaccine is licensed and introduced in the population, post-licensure studies are required to measure vaccine effectiveness and impact of vaccination programmes on the population at large. However, confusion still prevails around these concepts, making it difficult to discern which effects are measured in such studies and how their findings should be interpreted. We review from the public health evaluation perspective the effects of vaccine-related exposures, describe the methods used to measure them and their assumptions. We distinguish effects due to exposure to individual vaccination from those due to exposure to a vaccination programme, as the latter depends on vaccine coverage, other population factors and includes indirect effects as well. Vaccine (direct) effectiveness is estimated by comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals exposed to the same vaccination programme. The impact of a vaccination programme, defined here as the population prevented fraction when exposure is the programme, is measured by comparing populations with and without a vaccination programme, most commonly the same population before and after vaccination. These designs are based on a number of assumptions for valid inference. In particular, they assume that vaccinees and non-vaccinees do not differ in terms of susceptibility and exposure to the disease or in ascertainment of vaccination and disease status. In pre and post-vaccination design, the population is assumed to have similar baseline transmission, case detection and reporting, risk factors and medical practices in both periods. These principles are frequently violated in post-licensure studies. Potential confounding and biases must be minimized in study design and analyses, or taken into account during result interpretation. It is also essential to define which exposure is evaluated (individual vaccination or vaccination programme) and which effect is measured. This may help decision-makers clarify which type of study is needed and how to interpret the results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In selecting treatment of acute otitis media (AOM), knowledge of its etiology would be valuable. We revisited the possibility to use the nasopharyngeal culture of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pnc) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) for predicting their presence in the middle ear fluid (MEF) during AOM. METHODS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of bacterial culture of the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) in predicting the presence of the same pathogen in the MEF were assessed during AOM events among children followed from 2 to 24 months of age. RESULTS: The data comprised 586 AOM events. For Pnc, the sensitivity and NPV were high, 99{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval = 95-100{\%}) and {\textgreater}99{\%} (97-100{\%}), respectively. The specificity and PPV were relatively low, 63{\%} (57-68{\%}) and 50{\%} (43-56{\%}). For Hi, the sensitivity and the NPV were lower (77{\%}, 69-83{\%} and 93{\%}, 90-95{\%}) than for Pnc, but the specificity and the PPV were higher (88{\%}, 85-91{\%} and 64{\%}, 56-71{\%}). The quantity of Pnc and Hi in the NPA was clearly related to their presence in the MEF. If both Pnc and Hi were found in the nasopharynx, Hi was more likely cultured from MEF. CONCLUSION: Together with clinical and epidemiologic features of AOM, the nasopharyngeal culture can be helpful in selecting specific antimicrobial therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to understand clinicians' and parents' perceptions of communication within consultations for respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children and what influence clinician communication had on parents' understanding of antibiotic treatment. METHODS We video recorded 60 primary care consultations for children aged 3 months to 12 years who presented with RTI and cough in 6 primary care practices in England. We then used purposive sampling to select 27 parents and 13 clinicians for semistructured video-elicitation interviews. The videos were used as prompts to investigate participants' understanding and views of communication within the consultations. We analyzed the interview data thematically. RESULTS While clinicians commonly told parents that antibiotics are not effective against viruses, this did not have much impact on parents' beliefs about the need to consult or on their expectations concerning antibiotics. Parents believed that antibiotics were needed to treat more severe illnesses, a belief that was supported by the way clinicians accompanied viral diagnoses with problem-minimizing language and antibiotic prescriptions with more problem-oriented language. Antibiotic prescriptions tended to confirm parents' beliefs about what indicated illness severity, which often took into account the wider impact on a child's life. While parents understood antimicrobial resistance poorly, most held beliefs that supported reduced antibiotic prescribing. A minority attributed it to resource rationing, however. CONCLUSIONS Clinician communication and prescribing behavior confirm parents' beliefs that antibiotics are needed to treat more severe illnesses. Interventions to reduce antibiotic expectations need to address communication within the consultation, prescribing behavior, and lay beliefs.},

abstract = {Before conjugate pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs) were introduced it was estimated that Streptococcus pneumoniae caused 500,000 cases of pneumonia, 50,000 cases of bacteremia and 3000 cases of meningitis annually in the United States in both children and adults. After 10 years of routine use of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) the incidence of vaccine-type pneumococcal diseases (PDs) had significantly decreased in vaccinated children (direct effect) and unvaccinated subjects of all ages (indirect effect). Second generation, higher-valent PCVs, especially 13-valent (PCV13), routinely implemented since 2010, have reduced the incidence of PDs caused by the six additional non-PCV7 serotypes, in both vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. The licence for this vaccine has recently been extended to include adults aged 18 to 49 in Europe. Although PCV13 has an indirect effect on IPD in adults, this will probably not achieve the same level of disease control in adults and the elderly (especially those at high risk) as that obtained in vaccinated children. As highlighted in this paper, differences exist between children and adults for PD manifestations (incidence, morbidity and mortality) and serotypes isolated in nasopharyngeal carriage and diseases, so benefits from adult vaccination must be considered in this light. PCV13 induces an immune response in adults that is non-inferior for all serotypes common with the 23-valent plain polysaccharide vaccine that is currently recommended for adults and even superior for many serotypes. Although there is no evidence that this immune response translates to clinical efficacy in adults as seen in children, the results from a randomised trial in The Netherlands, expected in 2014, should provide the missing evidence. This evidence and efficient surveillance systems should provide the necessary data, essential for policy makers in their decisions on adult pneumococcal vaccination policies.},

abstract = {The present study evaluated changes in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and the pattern of serotypes isolated in Navarre, Spain, after the introduction and increased coverage of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). All cases with isolation of pneumococcus from normally sterile bodily fluids were included. The incidence of IPD in children and adults was compared for the periods 2001-2002 and 2006-2007. By the end of 2002, only 11{\%} of children aged {\textless}5 years had received any dose of PCV7, whereas, beginning in 2007, the proportion exceeded 50{\%}. Among the cases of IPD aged {\textless}5 years, the percentage of those vaccinated increased from 7{\%} during 2001-2002 to 53{\%} during 2006-2007 (p {\textless}0.001). The incidence of IPD from PCV7-serotypes decreased by 85{\%} in children {\textless}5 years (p {\textless}0.001), by 45{\%} in the population aged 5-64 years (p 0.10) and by 68{\%} in those {\textgreater}or=65 years (p 0.004). By contrast, the incidence of IPD from non-PCV7 serotypes increased by 40{\%} overall (p 0.006). The incidence of IPD from all serotypes did not change significantly in children {\textless}5 years (from 83 to 72 per 100 000) or in the total population (from 15.8 to 16.3 per 100 000). The percentage of cases as a result of serotypes 7 and 19A increased significantly in both children and adults. No significant changes were seen in the clinical forms of IPD. The pattern of serotypes causing IPD has changed, in both children and adults, following the increased coverage of PCV7, although the incidence has been reduced only slightly.},

abstract = {Objective: Financial support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) to introduce the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) into the routine childhood immunization schedule in Georgia is ending in 2015. As a result, the Interagency Coordination Committee (ICC) decided to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis to gather additional evidence to advocate for an appropriate evidence-based decision after GAVI support is over. The study also aimed to strengthen national capacity to conduct cost-effectiveness studies, and to introduce economic evaluations into Georgia's decision-making process. Methodology: A multidisciplinary team of national experts led by a member of the ICC carried out the analysis that compared two scenarios: introducing PCV10 vs no vaccination. The TRIVAC model was used to evaluate 10 cohorts of children over the period 2014-2023. National data was used to inform demographics, disease burden, vaccine coverage, health service utilization, and costs. Evidence from clinical trials and the scientific literature was used to estimate the impact of the vaccine. A 3. +. 0 schedule and a vaccine price increasing to US{\$} 3.50 per dose was assumed for the base-case scenario. Alternative univariate and multivariate scenarios were evaluated. Results: Over the 10-year period, PCV10 was estimated to prevent 7170 (8288 undiscounted) outpatient visits due to all-cause acute otitis media, 5325 (6154 undiscounted) admissions due to all-cause pneumonia, 87 (100 undiscounted) admissions due to pneumococcal meningitis, and 508 (588 undiscounted) admissions due to pneumococcal non-pneumonia and non-meningitis (NPNM). In addition, the vaccine was estimated to prevent 41 (48 undiscounted) deaths. This is equivalent to approximately 5 deaths and 700 admissions prevented each year in Georgia. Over the 10-year period, PCV10 would cost the government approximately US{\$} 4.4 million ({\$}440,000 per year). However, about half of this would be offset by the treatment costs prevented. The discounted cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be US{\$} 1599 per DALY averted with scenarios ranging from US{\$} 286 to US{\$} 7787. Discussion: This study led to better multi-sectoral collaboration and improved national capacity to perform economic evaluations. Routine infant vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae would be highly cost-effective in Georgia. The decision to introduce PCV10 was already made some time before the study was initiated but it provided important economic evidence in support of that decision. There are several uncertainties around many of the parameters used, but a multivariate scenario analysis with several conservative assumptions (including no herd effect in older individuals) shows that this recommendation is robust. This study supports the decision to introduce PCV10 in Georgia.},

In this article we explore the methodological challenges in these analyses and offer direction for future evaluations in the area. We identify alternative approaches to addressing these challenges, which include the estimation of disease changes attributable to vaccination efforts, the hypothetical no vaccination comparator scenario and the full benefit achieved by implemented vaccination programmes. We also outline other important considerations such as the evolution of prices over time. Further work needs to be done to explore these issues and to determine how the application of different approaches may impact on the results of evaluations in various circumstances. As retrospective analyses are likely to become more frequent and influential, it is important that both the benefits and the limitations of post-implementation evaluations are recognised and understood. We argue that it would be useful to establish a methodological framework to provide standards and guidance on how to undertake such analyses in the future.},

To assess the effectiveness of these interventions, and when more are effective - which works best. And to analyse the costs associated with these interventions. Methods: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase and CENTRAL bibliographies for studies on the effectiveness of strategies aimed at changing health care professionals' behavior in the management of children with URTIs. Results: The search yielded 11,788 references, of which 18 studies were eligible, and 10 met the inclusion criteria. Most strategies were aimed at changing antibiotic prescribing behavior in children with acute otitis media. All strategies used (i.e. computer interventions, educational sessions with or without education materials, collaborative development of guidelines and a training video in combination with a risk factor checklist) were effective in changing health care professionals practice regarding children with URTIs. Multifaceted and computer strategies work best. Computer interventions reduced antibiotic prescribing by 4{\%} and 34{\%} and increased guideline compliance by 41{\%}. Educational sessions combined with education materials reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescription by 2{\%} and 17{\%} and increased knowledge of compliance enhancing strategies by 28{\%} and 29{\%}. Collaborative guideline development combined with educational materials reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescription by 24{\%} and 40{\%}. Finally, by a combination of a training video and a risk factor checklist appropriate referrals by the GP to the otolaryngologist increased by 37{\%}. Since the costs associated with the interventions were not explicitly mentioned in the articles, no conclusion on cost-effectiveness can be drawn. Conclusion: Multifaceted and computer strategies appear to be most effective to put evidence into practice in the area of URTIs in children. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: In Quebec, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) program was implemented in December 2004. The recommended schedule is 2 + 1 doses for low-risk infants. PCV-7 was first used (including catch-up for children {\textless}5 years of age), replaced by PCV10 in June 2009, and by PCV13 in January 2011 (no catch-up in both instances). From the beginning, {\textgreater}90{\%} of children received the recommended number of doses. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the three PCVs sequentially used to prevent invasive infectious disease (IPD). Methods: IPD cases in children 2-59 months during the years 2005-2013 were eligible. Controls were randomly identified in the provincial health insurance registry. Parents were interviewed and immunization records reviewed. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was computed using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Out of 889 IPD cases reported, full participation was obtained for 516 cases (58{\%}) and for 1767 controls. Against vaccine-type IPD, VE (≥1 dose) was 90{\%} (82-95{\%}) for PCV7, 97{\%} (84-99{\%}) for PCV10 and 86{\%} (62-95{\%}) for PCV13. Against 19A IPD, VE was, respectively, 42{\%} (-9{\%} to 69{\%}), 71{\%} (24-89{\%}), and 74{\%} (11-92{\%}). VE (≥2 doses) against PCV13-type IPD was 85{\%} for PCV10 (66-94{\%}), 85{\%} for PCV13 (55-94{\%}), and 89{\%} (58-97{\%}) for a mixed PCV10 + PCV13 schedule. Conclusions: All three PCV vaccines showed high level of protection against IPD caused by serotypes included in their formulation and there was a high level of cross-protection against 19A for PCV10. No substantial difference was seen between PCV10, PCV13, or a mixed PCV10 + PCV13 schedule.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE  Despite extensive use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the increased bleeding risk associated with such OAC use, no handy quantification tool for assessing this risk exists. We aimed to develop a practical risk score to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding (intracranial, hospitalization, hemoglobin decrease {\textgreater} 2 g/L, and/or transfusion) in a cohort of real-world patients with AF.   METHODS  Based on 3,978 patients in the Euro Heart Survey on AF with complete follow-up, all univariate bleeding risk factors in this cohort were used in a multivariate analysis along with historical bleeding risk factors. A new bleeding risk score termed HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly ({\textgreater} 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) was calculated, incorporating risk factors from the derivation cohort.   RESULTS  Fifty-three (1.5{\%}) major bleeds occurred during 1-year follow-up. The annual bleeding rate increased with increasing risk factors. The predictive accuracy in the overall population using significant risk factors in the derivation cohort (C statistic 0.72) was consistent when applied in several subgroups. Application of the new bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) gave similar C statistics except where patients were receiving antiplatelet agents alone or no antithrombotic therapy, with C statistics of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively.   CONCLUSION  This simple, novel bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) provides a practical tool to assess the individual bleeding risk of real-world patients with AF, potentially supporting clinical decision making regarding antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF.},

abstract = {Background Limiting the duration of antimicrobial treatment constitutes a potential strategy to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance among children with acute otitis media. Methods We assigned 520 children, 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate either for a standard duration of 10 days or for a reduced duration of 5 days followed by placebo for 5 days. We measured rates of clinical response (in a systematic fashion, on the basis of signs and symptomatic response), recurrence, and nasopharyngeal colonization, and we analyzed episode outcomes using a noninferiority approach. Symptom scores ranged from 0 to 14, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. Results Children who were treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5 days were more likely than those who were treated for 10 days to have clinical failure (77 of 229 children [34{\%}] vs. 39 of 238 [16{\%}]; difference, 17 percentage points [based on unrounded data]; 95{\%} confidence interval, 9 to 25). The mean symptom scores over the period from day 6 to day 14 were 1.61 in the 5-day group and 1.34 in the 10-day group (P=0.07); the mean scores at the day-12-to-14 assessment were 1.89 versus 1.20 (P=0.001). The percentage of children whose symptom scores decreased more than 50{\%} (indicating less severe symptoms) from baseline to the end of treatment was lower in the 5-day group than in the 10-day group (181 of 227 children [80{\%}] vs. 211 of 233 [91{\%}], P=0.003). We found no significant between-group differences in rates of recurrence, adverse events, or nasopharyngeal colonization with penicillin-nonsusceptible pathogens. Clinical-failure rates were greater among children who had been exposed to three or more children for 10 or more hours per week than among those with less exposure (P=0.02) and were also greater among children with infection in both ears than among those with infection in one ear (P{\textless}0.001). Conclusions Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, reduced-duration antimicrobial treatment resulted in less favorable outcomes than standard-duration treatment; in addition, neither the rate of adverse events nor the rate of emergence of antimicrobial resistance was lower with the shorter regimen.

Day care-attending unvaccinated children in PnCRM7 communities were less likely to have VT colonization than those in control communities (OR, 0.27 [95{\%} CI, 0.07-1.07]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PnCRM7 reduces the risk of VT acquisition and colonization density but increases the risk of NVT acquisition among vaccinees and their household contacts.},

abstract = {Childhood pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. The incidence in this age group is estimated to be 0.29 episodes per child-year in developing and 0.05 episodes per child-year in developed countries. This translates into about 156 million new episodes each year worldwide, of which 151 million episodes are in the developing world. Most cases occur in India (43 million), China (21 million) and Pakistan (10 million), with additional high numbers in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria (6 million each). Of all community cases, 7-13{\%} are severe enough to be life-threatening and require hospitalization. Substantial evidence revealed that the leading risk factors contributing to pneumonia incidence are lack of exclusive breastfeeding, undernutrition, indoor air pollution, low birth weight, crowding and lack of measles immunization. Pneumonia is responsible for about 19{\%} of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years, of which more than 70{\%} take place in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia. Although based on limited available evidence, recent studies have identified Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and respiratory syncytial virus as the main pathogens associated with childhood pneumonia.},

abstract = {Objectives: To determine patterns of ambulatory antibiotic prescribing in US adults, including the use of broad-spectrum versus narrow-spectrum agents, to provide a description of the diagnoses for which antibiotics are pre-scribed and to identify patient and physician factors associated with broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing. Methods: We used data for patients aged ≥18 years from the National Ambulatory and National Hospital Ambu-latory Medical Care Surveys (2007– 09). These are nationally representative surveys of patient visits to offices, hos-pital outpatient departments and emergency departments (EDs) in the USA, collectively referred to as ambulatory visits. We determined the types of antibiotics prescribed, including the use of broad-spectrum versus narrow-spec-trum antibiotics, and examined prescribing patterns by diagnoses. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing. Results: Antibiotics were prescribed during 101 million (95{\%} CI: 91 –111 million) ambulatory visits annually, repre-senting 10{\%} of all visits. Broad-spectrum agents were prescribed during 61{\%} of visits in which antibiotics were pre-scribed. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were quinolones (25{\%} of antibiotics), macrolides (20{\%}) and aminopenicillins (12{\%}). Antibiotics were most commonly prescribed for respiratory conditions (41{\%} of antibiotics), skin/mucosal conditions (18{\%}) and urinary tract infections (9{\%}). In multivariable analysis, among patients pre-scribed antibiotics, broad-spectrum agents were more likely to be prescribed than narrow-spectrum antibiotics for respiratory infections for which antibiotics are rarely indicated (e.g. bronchitis), during visits to EDs and for patients ≥60 years. Conclusions: Broad-spectrum agents constitute the majority of antibiotics in ambulatory care. More than 25{\%} of prescriptions are for conditions for which antibiotics are rarely indicated. Antibiotic stewardship interventions tar-geting respiratory and non-respiratory conditions are needed in ambulatory care.},

abstract = {Longitudinal data analysis methods are powerful tools for exploring scientific questions regarding change and are well suited to evaluate the impact of a new policy. However, there are challenging aspects of policy change data that require consideration, such as defining comparison groups, separating the effect of time from that of the policy, and accounting for heterogeneity in the policy effect. We compare currently available methods to evaluate a policy change and illustrate issues specific to a policy change analysis via a case study of laws that eliminate gun-use restrictions (shall-issue laws) and firearm-related homicide. We obtain homicide rate ratios estimating the effect of enacting a shall-issue law, which vary between 0.903 and 1.101. We conclude that in a policy change analysis it is essential to select a mean model that most accurately characterizes the anticipated effect of the policy intervention, thoroughly model temporal trends, and select methods that accommodate unit-specific policy effects. We also conclude that several longitudinal data analysis methods are useful to evaluate a policy change, but not all may be appropriate in certain contexts. Analysts must carefully decide which methods are appropriate for their application and must be aware of the differences between methods to select a procedure that generates valid inference.},

The aim was to investigate the prevalence of pneumococcal serotypes isolated from middle ear (ME), lower respiratory tract (LRT) and from invasive disease (IPD) in Iceland prior to implementation of ten-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV-10) into the infant vaccination program (April 2011). METHODS AND FINDINGS All isolates cultured 2007-2011 from ME, LRT and IPD identified as pneumococci were serotyped and tested for susceptibility at the Clinical Microbiology Department, Landspitali University Hospital that serves approximately 85{\%} of the Icelandic population. Pneumococcal isolates were 1711 and 1616 (94.4{\%}) were available for serotyping and included. Isolates belonging to PHiD-CV10 serotypes (VTs) were 1052 (65.1{\%}). Isolates from ME were 879 (54.4{\%}), with 639 (72.7{\%}) from 0-1 year old patients and 651 of VTs (74{\%}). Isolates from LRT were 564 (34.9{\%}), with 292 (51.8{\%}) from ≥65 years old patients, and 300 (53.2{\%}) of VTs. IPD isolates were 173 (10.7{\%}), although more evenly distributed according to age than isolates from the other sites most were from adults and the youngest age group,101 (58.4{\%}) isolates were of VTs. The most common serotype was 19F, 583 (36.1{\%}). Its prevalence was highest in ME, 400 (45.5{\%}), 172 (30.5{\%}) in LRT and 11 isolates (6.4{\%}), in IPD. Penicillin non-susceptible isolates were 651 (40.3{\%}), mainly belonging to VTs, 611 (93.9{\%}), including 535 (82.2{\%}) of 19F. CONCLUSIONS Multiresistant isolates of serotype 19F were highly prevalent, especially from ME of young children but also from LRT of adults. Serotype 14 was the most common serotype in IPD. The rate of VTs was high and almost all PNSP were of VTs. There was great difference in vaccine coverage between sampling sites, also reflecting difference in vaccine coverage by age groups.},

The 7-valent PCV (PCV-7) has been extensively evaluated in clinical trials, and recent evidence from the introduction of PCV-7 through national immunization programs has demonstrated impact on pneumococcal disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Clinical trials have shown PCV-7 to be effective against the more severe forms of pneumococcal infections: pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), as well as overall child mortality. A review shows the tremendous impact PCV-7 has had to date, and the potential further benefits of the emerging multi-valent vaccines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Since its introduction, the PCV-7 has substantially reduced the incidence of IPD, hospital admissions due to pneumonia and acute otitis media in numerous, mostly high income, low-disease burden countries. The reductions in IPD and pneumonia have also been observed among unvaccinated age groups in countries with routine use of PCV-7, demonstrating that PCV-7 provides herd immunity. Some settings observed an increase in rate of nonvaccine serotype IPD, yet rates of overall and vaccine-serotype IPD show marked reductions post-PCV-7 introduction. Limited data are available on the impact of PCV-7 in lower income countries. The available data from efficacy trials from The Gambia and South Africa suggest that PCV-7 will have substantial impact on reducing pneumococcal disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: PCV-7 has shown dramatic reduction in disease and mortality rates in the countries in which it has been introduced. The newly introduced 10-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal vaccines are expected to have substantial disease impact, but monitoring is essential to determine their true impact and sustain further introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.},

Here, we report findings four years after vaccination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: PCV-7 was given to all children below 30 months of age enrolled in the trial and to those born during its course in all study villages. Villages were randomized (older children and adults) to receive PCV-7 (wholly vaccinated villages) or serogroup-C-meningococcal-conjugate-vaccine (partly vaccinated villages). Cross-sectional surveys (CSS) to collect nasopharyngeal swabs were conducted before and at various intervals after vaccination. Sixteen of these randomized villages (8 wholly vaccinated and 8 partly vaccinated) participated in a CSS conducted four years after vaccination started.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Four years after vaccination, the prevalence of VT pneumococcal carriage was slightly higher in partly than in wholly vaccinated villages [6.4{\%} versus 3.9{\%} (p = 0.120)] compared to 24.4{\%} in the pre-vaccination CSS (p{\textless}0.001). Prevalence of NVT four years after vaccination was similar between study groups [32.7{\%} versus 29.8{\%} (p = 0.392), respectively] compared to 51.1{\%} in the pre-vaccination CSS (p{\textless}0.001).

abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute otitis media is a common reason for antibiotic prescribing, despite strong evidence that antibiotics provide minimal benefit. Studies have demonstrated that patients' (or parents') expectations of antibiotics often influence general practitioners' (GPs) decision to prescribe antibiotics, but few have explored parents' expectations of the management of infections in children, or which factors influence the development of these expectations. This study aimed to explore parents' knowledge and beliefs about the management of acute otitis media in children. METHODS Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 parents of children who had recently presented to their GP with acute otitis media. Parents were recruited at childcare centres or playgroups in Brisbane, Australia. RESULTS Many parents did not have an accurate understanding of what causes acute otitis media. GPs were primarily consulted for the management of symptoms such as pain and fever. Others specifically wanted reassurance or were concerned about hearing loss. Most parents assumed that antibiotics were the best treatment option. Parents' perceptions about the best treatment were mainly based on their previous experience and the advice of the GP. Pain relief medications, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were not considered by parents to be sufficient treatment on their own. CONCLUSION There is discrepancy between parents' beliefs and expectations of management of acute otitis media and the evidence-based recommendations. This study provides insights into parents' expectations of management of acute otitis media, which may help inform clinicians about perceptions and misperceptions that may be valuable to elicit and discuss.},

abstract = {Importance Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remain at high risk for experiencing recurrent ischemic events. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been proposed for secondary prevention after ACS. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOAC in addition to antiplatelet therapy (APT) after ACS, focusing on treatment effects stratified by baseline clinical presentation (non-ST-segment elevation ACS [NSTE-ACS] vs ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]). Data Sources PubMed, Embase, BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to March 1, 2017. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials on DOAC after ACS were evaluated for inclusion. Overall, 473 studies were screened, 19 clinical trials were assessed as potentially eligible, and 6 were included in the meta-analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were used to abstract data and assess quality and validity. The risk of bias tool, version 2.0 (Cochrane) was used for risk of bias assessment. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures The prespecified primary efficacy end point was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The prespecified primary safety end point was major bleeding. Results Six trials that included 29 667 patients were identified (14 580 patients [49.1{\%}] with STEMI and 15 036 [50.7{\%}] with NSTE-ACS). The primary efficacy end point risk was significantly lower in patients who were treated with DOAC as compared with APT alone (odds ratio [OR], 0.85; 95{\%} CI, 0.77-0.93; P {\textless} .001). This benefit was pronounced in patients with STEMI (OR, 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.66-0.88; P {\textless} .001), while no significant treatment effect was observed in patients with NSTE-ACS (OR, 0.92; 95{\%} CI, 0.78-1.09; P = .36; P for interaction = .09). With respect to safety, DOACs were associated with a higher risk of major bleeding as compared with APT alone (OR, 3.17; 95{\%} CI, 2.27-4.42; P {\textless} .001), with consistent results in patients with STEMI (OR, 3.45; 95{\%} CI, 1.95-6.09; P {\textless} .001) and NSTE-ACS (OR, 2.19; 95{\%} CI, 1.38-3.48; P {\textless} .001; P for interaction = .23). Conclusions and Relevance To our knowledge, these findings are the first evidence to support differential treatment effects of DOAC in addition to APT according to ACS baseline clinical presentation. In patients with NSTE-ACS, the risk-benefit profile of DOAC appears unfavorable. Conversely, DOAC in addition to APT might represent an attractive option for patients with STEMI.},

The data were analysed using multilevel modelling. The study identified, and allowed the quantification of, contact patterns within this sample that may be of epidemiological significance. For example, the degree of assortativeness of mixing with respect to age was dependent not only on the age of participants but the number of contacts made. Estimates of the relative magnitude of contact rates between different social settings were made, with implications for outbreak potential. Simple questionnaire modifications are suggested which would yield information on the structure and dynamics of social networks and the intensity of contacts. Surveys of this nature may enable the quantification of who acquires infection from whom and from where.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial drugs are frequently prescribed to children for respiratory tract infections such as otitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia. We assessed the effect of the ten-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10; GlaxoSmithKline) on antimicrobial purchases. METHODS: In this nationwide phase 3-4 cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, children younger than 19 months were randomly assigned to receive PHiD-CV10 in 52 of 78 clusters or hepatitis B or A vaccine as control in 26 clusters according to three plus one or two plus one schedules (infants younger than 7 months) or catch-up schedules (children aged 7-18 months). The main objective for the antimicrobial treatment outcome was to assess vaccine effectiveness against outpatient prescriptions of antimicrobial drugs recommended by national treatment guidelines for acute otitis media in Finland in children who received at least one dose of study vaccine before 7 months of age. Masked follow-up lasted from the date of first vaccination (from Feb 18, 2009, through Oct 5, 2010) to Dec 31, 2011. We obtained data on all purchased antimicrobial prescriptions through the benefits register of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. This and the nested acute otitis media trial are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00861380 and NCT00839254. FINDINGS: More than 47,000 children were enrolled. In 30,527 infants younger than 7 months at enrollment, 98,436 outpatient antimicrobial purchases were reported with incidence of 1.69 per person-year in the control clusters. Analysis of the main objective included 91{\%} of all antimicrobial purchases: 31,982 in the control and 57,964 in the PHiD-CV10 clusters. Vaccine effectiveness was 8{\%} (95{\%} CI 1-14) and the incidence rate difference 0.12 per person-year corresponding to the number needed to vaccinate of five (95{\%} CI 3-67) to prevent one purchase during the 2 year follow-up for combined PHiD-CV10 three plus one and two plus one infant schedules. The vaccine effectiveness was identical for the two infant schedules. In the catch-up schedules, the vaccine effectiveness was 3{\%} (95{\%} CI -4 to 10). INTERPRETATION: Despite low relative rate reductions the absolute rate reductions were substantial because of the high incidence of the outcome. This reduction would lead to over 12,000 fewer antimicrobial purchases per year in children younger than 24 months in Finland (birth cohort of 60,000 children).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis of pediatric vaccines for infectious diseases often requires quality-of-life (utility) weights.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate how utility weights have been elicited and used in this context.

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies published between January 1990 and July 2013 that elicited or used utility weights in cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccines for pediatric populations. The review focused on vaccines for 17 infectious diseases and is presented following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology.

RESULTS: A total of 6410 titles and abstracts and 225 full-text articles were reviewed. Of those selected for inclusion (n = 101), 15 articles described the elicitation of utility weights and 86 described economic modeling studies using utilities. Various methods were used to generate utilities, including time trade-off, contingent valuation, and willingness to pay, as well as a preference-based measure with associated value sets, such as the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire or the Health Utilities Index. In modeling studies, the source of utilities used was often unclear, poorly reported, or based on weak underlying evidence. We found no articles that reported on the elicitation or use of utilities in diphtheria, polio, or tetanus.

CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of appropriate utility weights for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children and a lack of standardization in their use in economic assessments limit the ability to accurately assess the benefits associated with interventions to prevent infectious diseases. This is an issue that should be of concern to those making decisions regarding the prevention and treatment of infectious childhood illnesses.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae can asymptomatically colonize the nasopharynx and cause a diverse range of illnesses. This clinical spectrum from colonization to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) appears to depend on the pneumococcal capsular serotype rather than the genetic background. According to a literature review, serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 8, 12F, 14, 18C, and 19A are more likely to cause IPD. Although serotypes 1 and 19A are the predominant causes of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, serotype 14 remains one of the most common etiologic agents of non-bacteremic pneumonia in adults, even after 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduction. Serotypes 1, 3, and 19A pneumococci are likely to cause empyema and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Serotype 1 pneumococcal meningitis is prevalent in the African meningitis belt, with a high fatality rate. In contrast to the capsule type, genotype is more closely associated with antibiotic resistance. CC320/271 strains expressing serotype 19A are multidrug-resistant (MDR) and prevalent worldwide in the era of PCV7. Several clones of MDR serotype 6C pneumococci emerged, and a MDR 6D clone (ST282) has been identified in Korea. Since the pneumococcal epidemiology of capsule types varies geographically and temporally, a nationwide serosurveillance system is vital to establishing appropriate vaccination strategies for each country.},

abstract = {The threat to human health posed by antibiotic resistance is of growing concern. Many commensal and pathogenic organisms have developed resistance to well established and newer antibiotics. The major selection pressure driving changes in the frequency of antibiotic resistance is the volume of drug use. However, establishing a quantitative relationship between the frequency of resistance and volume of drug use has proved difficult. Using population genetic methods and epidemiological observations, we report an analysis of the influence of the selective pressure imposed by the volume of drug use on temporal changes in resistance. Analytical expressions are derived to delineate key relationships between resistance and drug consumption. The analyses indicate that the time scale for emergence of resistance under a constant selective pressure is typically much shorter than the decay time after cessation or decline in the volume of drug use and that significant reductions in resistance require equally significant reductions in drug consumption. These results highlight the need for early intervention once resistance is detected.},

abstract = {Background: Quebec was the first jurisdiction in the world to recommend a 3-dose (2. +. 1) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) schedule. The program was implemented in December 2004 with a catch-up for children {\textless}5 years. PCV-7 was first used and replaced, respectively, by PCV-10 in 2009 and by PCV-13 in 2011. Methods: Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) notified to public health authorities and isolates submitted to the provincial reference laboratory during the period 2000-2011 were analyzed. Results: IPD incidence in children {\textless}5 years was 67/100,000 in 2001-2004, and decreased to 32/100,000 in 2007-2009 following PCV-7 implementation (p{\textless} 0.01). A further decrease to 24/100,000 was observed in 2010-2011 following PCV-10 introduction (p{\textless} 0.01). PCV-7 serotypes represented 82{\%} of the total IPD cases in 2000-2004 and elimination was achieved in 2011. Main emerging serotypes were 19A and 7F. Children exposed to the PCV-10 experienced lower IPD rates and all serotypes contributed to the decline, mainly 7F and 19A. In adults, a decrease of low magnitude was observed in 2005-2006 but rates in 2007-2009 were higher than in the prevaccination period. Conclusions: A 3-dose PCV schedule with high uptake is highly effective and should be recommended worldwide. Serotype replacement eroded benefits especially in adults. PCV-10 introduction had an effect and the impact of PCV-13 use remains to be evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Two samples of children attended at the University Hospital Sant Joan de D{\'{e}}u (Barcelona, Spain) between 2007 and 2011 were compared: a first sample of 358 children with invasive pneumococcal disease and a second sample of 402 pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriers selected from 714 healthy children admitted for minor surgical procedures. The most common invasive serotypes were 1 (20.1 {\%}, n = 72), 19A (13.9 {\%}, n = 50), 3 (12.3 {\%}, n = 44), and 7FA (7.5 {\%}, n = 27), whereas the most common serotypes in carriage were 19A (8.7 {\%}, n = 38), 10FC33C (7.8 {\%}, n = 34), 6C (6.9 {\%}, n = 30), and 19FBC (5.5 {\%}, n = 24). We detected a rate of cocolonization of 26.4 {\%} (n = 89) among the 336 samples serotyped in the carriers population. Serotypes 1, 3, and 7FA were significantly associated with high invasiveness.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was licensed in the United States in February 2000 and, following national guidelines, universally distributed in Massachusetts starting in July 2000 to children younger than 2 years of age and selected children 2-5 years of age. We performed statewide surveillance for all cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children younger than 18 years of age to determine risk features and contribution of vaccine failure to ongoing pneumococcal invasive disease. METHODS: Massachusetts pediatric IPD cases were identified via enhanced passive surveillance of microbiology laboratory reports of pneumococcal isolates from sterile body sites of children younger than 18 years for 2 years starting in October 2001. Serotyping was performed on isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from normally sterile body fluid. Case demographic and clinical data (including dates of prior doses of PCV7) were collected via follow-up telephone interviews with case primary care providers and/or parents. RESULTS: Between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2003, 191 cases of IPD were identified statewide (138 in children younger than 5 years). Annual incidence rate for IPD was 17.4 per 100,000 children younger than 5 years, representing a decline of 69{\%} when compared with annual incidence rate of 56.9 per 100,000 from Massachusetts statewide active surveillance performed 1990-1991. In 2001-2003, 30{\%} of cases occurred in the first year of life (36.5 per 100,000), representing a 7.8-fold increased risk compared with children older than 1 year of age. Race-specific annual incidence rates in blacks and Hispanics were 2.3-fold (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.21-4.42) and 1.9-fold (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.06-3.37), greater than in whites. Fifty-nine cases were reported to have underlying comorbid conditions. Serotyping was available for 136 of 191 (71{\%}) cases younger than 18 years; of isolates available for serotyping, 40 (29{\%}) were vaccine serotype (ST), 31 (23{\%}) vaccine-related ST and 65 (48{\%}) nonvaccine ST. Seven of 40 cases with IPD caused by vaccine ST received at least 3 doses of PCV7 vaccine before IPD. CONCLUSIONS: Universal administration of PCV7 to children younger than 2 years of age and selective administration to children 2-5 years of age has resulted in a significant decline in IPD in Massachusetts. Children younger than 1 year of age, African American and Hispanic children and those with recognized comorbid illnesses (malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus, immune deficiency, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) continue to remain at risk for IPD. These risk features should be considered when evaluating febrile infants and children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The recent series of reviews conducted within the Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) addressed epidemiology of the two deadly diseases at the global and regional level; it also estimated the effectiveness of interventions, barriers to achieving high coverage and the main implications for health policy. The aim of this paper is to provide the estimates of childhood pneumonia at the country level. This should allow national policy-makers and stakeholders to implement proposed policies in the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF member countries. METHODS WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS TO UPDATE PREVIOUS ESTIMATES OF THE GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BURDEN OF CHILDHOOD PNEUMONIA INCIDENCE, SEVERE MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, RISK FACTORS AND SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MOST COMMON PATHOGENS: Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (flu). We distributed the global and regional-level estimates of the number of cases, severe cases and deaths from childhood pneumonia in 2010-2011 by specific countries using an epidemiological model. The model was based on the prevalence of the five main risk factors for childhood pneumonia within countries (malnutrition, low birth weight, non-exclusive breastfeeding in the first four months, solid fuel use and crowding) and risk effect sizes estimated using meta-analysis. FINDINGS The incidence of community-acquired childhood pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in the year 2010, using World Health Organization's definition, was about 0.22 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.11-0.51) episodes per child-year (e/cy), with 11.5{\%} (IQR 8.0-33.0{\%}) of cases progressing to severe episodes. This is a reduction of nearly 25{\%} over the past decade, which is consistent with observed reductions in the prevalence of risk factors for pneumonia throughout LMIC. At the level of pneumonia incidence, RSV is the most common pathogen, present in about 29{\%} of all episodes, followed by influenza (17{\%}). The contribution of different pathogens varies by pneumonia severity strata, with viral etiologies becoming relatively less important and most deaths in 2010 caused by the main bacterial agents - SP (33{\%}) and Hib (16{\%}), accounting for vaccine use against these two pathogens. CONCLUSIONS In comparison to 2000, the primary epidemiological evidence contributing to the models of childhood pneumonia burden has improved only slightly; all estimates have wide uncertainty bounds. Still, there is evidence of a decreasing trend for all measures of the burden over the period 2000-2010. The estimates of pneumonia incidence, severe morbidity, mortality and etiology, although each derived from different and independent data, are internally consistent - lending credibility to the new set of estimates. Pneumonia continues to be the leading cause of both morbidity and mortality for young children beyond the neonatal period and requires ongoing strategies and progress to reduce the burden further.},

Methods: Registry based cross-sectional study with complete data on surgery for otitis media in 2002; 21,811 Finnish and Norwegian children aged 0-16 years. Results: Total rates for otitis media surgery were 82.5 and 146.5 per 10,000 children in Norway and Finland, respectively. Adenoidectomies were four times more frequently performed in Finland and rates for tympanostomy tube insertions differed 2-3-fold, Finland having the higher rate. The contrast in surgery rates was most striking in the age group 0-2 years. Further, the more sparsely populated regions had significantly higher overall surgery rates. Conclusion: The large variability in the incidence of otitis media surgery between two similar countries questions whether present guidelines ensure equal treatment in similarly affected children and pinpoints the difficulty in giving advice on age, time and type of surgery. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {AIMS: To ascertain whether the reduction in nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes induced by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PnCV) administered to infants persists beyond the age of 2 years. METHODS: Non-randomised, unblinded controlled study of 2-5 year old children who had received three doses of heptavalent PnCV (7VPnCV) in infancy and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at 13 months, and unimmunised controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken in summer (150 vaccinated subjects, 126 controls) and winter (143 vaccinated subjects, 188 controls). The swabs were cultured and serotyped for Streptococcus pneumoniae. RESULTS: Carriage rates (vaccinated subjects: 24.7{\%} and 43.4{\%}; controls: 27.0{\%} and 41.0{\%}, in summer and winter respectively) and carriage of vaccine serotypes (subjects: 10.0{\%} and 30.0{\%}; controls: 13.5{\%} and 31.5{\%}, in summer and winter respectively) were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of vaccination in infancy on rates of nasal carriage of pneumococcus and serotype replacement in children living in a largely unvaccinated population are no longer evident by 2-5 years of age.},

One hundred and eighty-two children (mean age 9.7 years; range 5.3-14.2) were selected randomly from a cohort of 674 school-age children who recovered from non-Haemophilus influenzae type B bacterial meningitis. These children had neither meningitis with 'complex onset', nor prior cognitive or behavioral problems, nor severe disease sequelae. On average 7.4 years after meningitis, they were evaluated using an 'Academic Achievement Test' and their parents filled in the Child Behavior Checklist, the Child Health Questionnaire, and the Health Utilities Index. The long-term incidence of academic and/or behavioral limitations was 32{\%}. Overall health-related quality of life of the postmeningitic children was decreased in comparison with that of a reference population of schoolchildren. The group of postmeningitic children with academic and/or behavioral limitations showed the most marked decrease in quality of life, especially concerning psychosocial health, cognition and family life. The negative effects on quality of life were not significantly influenced by age, gender, causative pathogen, presence of minor neurological impairment, or presence of hearing impairment. In conclusion, health-related quality of life of postmeningitic children is decreased, particularly of those with academic and/or behavioral limitations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Day care centre (DCC) attendees play a central role in maintaining the circulation of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in the population. Exposure within families and within DCCs are the main risk factors for colonisation with pneumococcal serotypes in DCC attendees. METHODS: Transmission of serotype specific carriage was analysed with a continuous time event history model, based on longitudinal data from day care attendees and their family members. Rates of acquisition, conditional on exposure, were estimated in a Bayesian framework utilising latent processes of carriage. To ensure a correct level of exposure, non-participating day care attendees and their family members were included in the analysis. Posterior predictive simulations were used to quantify transmission patterns within day care cohorts, to estimate the basic reproduction number for pneumococcal carriage in a population of day care cohorts, and to assess the critical vaccine efficacy against carriage to eliminate pneumococcal transmission. RESULTS: The model, validated by posterior predictive sampling, was successful in capturing the strong temporal clustering of pneumococcal serotypes in the day care cohorts. In average 2.7 new outbreaks of pneumococcal carriage initiate in a day care cohort each month. While 39{\%} of outbreaks were of size one, the mean outbreak size was 7.6 individuals and the mean length of an outbreak was 2.8 months. The role of families in creating and maintaining transmission was minimal, as only 10{\%} of acquisitions in day care attendees were from family members. Considering a population of day care cohorts, a child-to-child basic reproduction number was estimated as 1.4 and the critical vaccine efficacy against acquisition of carriage as 0.3. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal transmission occurs in serotype specific outbreaks of carriage, driven by within-day-care transmission and between-serotype competition. An amplifying effect of the day care cohorts enhances the spread of pneumococcal serotypes within the population. The effect of vaccination, in addition to reducing susceptibility to pneumococcal carriage in the vaccinated, induces a herd effect, thus creating a counter-effect to the amplifying effect of the cohort. Consequently, the critical vaccine efficacy against carriage, required for elimination of transmission, is relatively low. Use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines is expected to induce a notable herd protection against pneumococcal disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) was licensed to provide immunity against pneumococcal disease caused by seven serotypes of S. pneumoniae. Thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) includes 6 additional serotypes for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the potential health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with PCV-13 in the Community of Valencia and to generate valuable information for policy makers at regional and country levels.

METHODS: A decision tree was designed to determine the health and economic outcomes in hypothetical cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated children followed over their lifetime. Information about disease incidence and serotype distribution were gathered from local databases and from published and unpublished local records. PCV-13 effectiveness was extrapolated from PCV-7 efficacy data. A 5{\%} of herd effect and a serotype replacement of 25{\%} were considered for the base case scenario. Only direct costs were taken into account and results were expressed in terms of life-years gained (LYG) and quality adjusted life years (QALY).

RESULTS: Implementing a universal PCV-13 vaccination program in the Community of Valencia would decrease the number of hospital admitted pneumonia to less than 4571 cases while avoiding 310 cases of IPD and 82,596 cases of AOM throughout the cohort lifetime. A total of 190 S. pneumoniae related deaths would be averted over the same period. Total medical costs of non-vaccinating the cohort of newborns would reach up to 403,850.859€ compared to 438,762.712€ that would represent vaccinating the cohort. The incremental cost of vaccinating the children was estimated in 12,794€/LYG and 10,407€/QALY, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: A universal PCV-13 vaccination program in the Community of Valencia would be a cost-effective intervention from the payer perspective after preventing for pneumococcal infections and for decreasing its associated mortality and morbidity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been introduced in national immunisation programmes of most industrialised countries and recently in two African GAVI eligible countries (Rwanda and The Gambia). However the long term effects of PCV are still unclear, as beneficial direct and herd immunity effects might be countered by serotype replacement.

METHOD: A dynamic, age-structured, compartmental model of Streptococcus pneumoniae transmission was developed to predict the potential impact of PCV7 on the incidence of invasive disease accounting for both herd immunity and serotype replacement effects. The model was parameterised using epidemiological data from England and Wales and pre and post-vaccination surveillance data from the US.

RESULTS: Model projections showed that serotype replacement plays a crucial role in determining the overall effect of a PCV7 vaccination programme and could reduce, negate or outweigh its beneficial impact. However, using the estimate of the competition parameter derived from the US post-vaccination experience, an infant vaccination programme would prevent 39,000 IPD cases in the 20 years after PCV7 introduction in the UK. Adding a catch-up campaign for under 2 or under 5 year olds would provide a further reduction of 1,200 or 3,300 IPD cases respectively, mostly in the first few years of the programme.

CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that a PCV vaccination programme would eradicate vaccine serotypes from circulation. However, the increase in carriage of non-vaccine serotypes, and the consequent increase in invasive disease, could reduce, negate or outweigh the benefit. These results are sensitive to changes in the protective effect of the vaccine, and, most importantly, to the level of competition between vaccine and non-vaccine types. The techniques developed here can be used to assess the introduction of vaccination programmes in developing countries and provide the basis for cost-effectiveness analyses.},

abstract = {Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness (VE) are generally measured as 1 minus some measure of relative risk (RR) in the vaccinated group compared with the unvaccinated group (VE = 1 -RR). In designing a study to evaluate vaccination, the type of effect and the question of interest determine the appropriate choice of comparison population and parameter. Possible questions of interest include that of the biologic effect of vaccination on susceptibility, on infectiousness, or on progression to disease in individuals. The indirect effects, total effects, and overall public health benefits of widespread vaccination of individuals within the context of a vaccination program might also be of primary concern. The change in behavior induced by belief in the protective effects of vaccination might influence the estimates of these effects or might itself be of interest. In this paper, the authors present a framework of study designs that relates the scientific question of interest to the choice of comparison groups, the unit of observation, the level of information available for analysis, and the parameter of effect.

abstract = {Sex is a significant epidemiological factor for several diseases. However, the role of sex in the development and outcome of various infections has not been extensively studied with the notable exception of urinary tract infections. We searched in the PubMed database to identify articles that could provide relevant data regarding sex differences in the incidence and severity of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). We extracted data from 84 relevant studies that provided information regarding sex differences in the incidence and severity of RTIs. Females are more commonly affected with infections of the upper respiratory tract, specifically sinusitis, tonsillitis, and otitis externa. On the other hand, males are more commonly affected with otitis media, croup, and most important, lower RTIs. It is also evident from the reviewed evidence that the course of most RTIs is more severe in males than in females, leading to higher mortality in males, especially in community-acquired pneumonia. In conclusion, the available data suggest that males are more susceptible than females to most types of RTIs in all age groups (adults and children). Overall, it seems that males develop RTIs more frequently than females, except for sinusitis, otitis externa, and probably tonsillitis. Anatomic, lifestyle, behavioural, and socioeconomic differences between males and females may explain the observed findings. The role of sex hormones in the regulation of the immune system may also contribute to the reported sex differences in the incidence and severity of the various types of RTIs, especially in adolescents and adults.},

abstract = {To reduce the burden of pneumococcal diseases, different formulations of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have been introduced in many countries. In Brazil, PCV10 has been available since 2010. We aimed to analyze the serotype and genetic composition of invasive pneumococci from Brazil in pre- and post-vaccination periods (2007-2012). Antibiotic susceptibility was determined and genotypes of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance were characterized. The genotypes of isolates of the most frequent serotypes were determined by multilocus sequence typing. The study included 325 isolates, which were primarily recovered from blood. The most common serotypes recovered were 14, 3, 4, 23F, 7F, 9V, 12F, 20, 19F, 8, 19A, and 5. Thirty-eight pneumococci (11.7{\%}) were from children ≤5 years old. Considering the overall population, PCV10 and PCV13 serotype coverage was 50.1{\%} and 64.9{\%}, respectively. During the pre-vaccine period, isolates with serotypes belonging to the PVC10 represented 51.5{\%} (100/194), whereas in the post vaccine they represented 48.0{\%} (63/131). PCV13 serotypes represented 67.5{\%} (131/194) and 59.2{\%} (77/131) of total for pre- and post-vaccination periods, respectively. Seventy different sequence types [STs] were found, accounting for 9 clonal complexes [CCs] and 45 singletons. Eight STs (156, 180, 218, 8889, 53, 191, 770, and 4967) represented the majority (51.5{\%}) of isolates. Fifty STs were associated with the pre-vaccination period (27 exclusive) and 43 (20 exclusive) with the post-vaccination period; 23 STs were identified in both periods. Some serotypes were particularly clonal (7F, 8, 12F, 20). Non-susceptibility to penicillin was associated with serotype 19A, CC320. Erythromycin resistance was heterogeneous when considering serotype and ST. A single serotype 23F (ST4967) isolate was resistant to levofloxacin. Continued surveillance is required to determine vaccine impact and to monitor changes in pneumococcal population biology post-PCV10 introduction in Brazil.},

The Quellung reaction is the gold standard method for pneumococcal capsular serotyping. The method involves testing a pneumococcal cell suspension with pooled and specific antisera directed against the capsular polysaccharide. The antigen-antibody reactions are observed microscopically. The protocol has three main steps: 1) preparation of a bacterial cell suspension, 2) mixing of cells and antisera on a glass slide, and 3) reading the Quellung reaction using a microscope. The Quellung reaction is reasonably simple to perform and can be applied wherever a suitable microscope and antisera are available.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes in children with otitis media with effusion who received either medical treatment or ventilation tubes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 89 bilateral cases of otitis media with effusion in children who were recommended to receive ventilation tube insertion and were followed up for more than 5 years. Tympanic membrane was inspected by otoscopic examination. Hearing was evaluated with pure tone audiometry. The mean duration of follow-up was 8.4 years (range, 5.2-15.7 years). Twenty-three children were treated without surgery, while 22 were treated once by ventilation tube insertion and 44 were treated more than once by ventilation tube insertion. Results: At the fifth year of follow-up, both groups of children who underwent ventilation tube insertion had more frequent tympanic membrane abnormalities than the medication group (8.7{\%} in those treated without surgery, 72.7{\%} in those treated once by ventilation tube insertion, and 88.6{\%} in those treated more than once by ventilation tube insertion). Common tympanic membrane abnormalities were retraction (27.0{\%}) and tympanosclerotic plaque (23.6{\%}), regardless of the treatment modality. At the fifth year follow-up, the average air-conduction threshold was 10.0. dB (?? 6.5. dB) in patients treated without surgery, 15.9. dB (?? 11.2. dB) in patients treated once by ventilation tube insertion, and 17.8. dB (?? 7.6. dB) in those treated more than once by ventilation tube insertion. The audiological difference was significant when we compared the hearing level of children treated by medication without surgery to the two ventilation tube groups. Conclusion: Though ventilation tube insertion can resolve hearing loss quickly, there were more tympanic membrane abnormalities and a decline in hearing levels in our ventilation tube insertion group vs. the observation group measured 5 years later. Physicians should therefore be cautious when applying a ventilation tube in patients with otitis media with effusion and should explain the risks to patients who are a candidate for repeated ventilation tube insertion. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) are two recently approved vaccines for the active immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae causing invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and children. PCV13 offers broader protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae; however, PCV10 offers potential protection against non-typeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi). We examined public health and economic impacts of a PCV10 and PCV13 pediatric national immunization programs (NIPs) in Canada. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to examine the costs and outcomes associated with PCV10 and PCV13 pediatric NIPs. The model followed individuals over the remainder of their lifetime. Recent disease incidence, serotype coverage, population data, percent vaccinated, costs, and utilities were obtained from the published literature. Direct and indirect effects were derived from 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Additional direct effect of 4{\%} was attributed to PCV10 for moderate to severe acute otitis media to account for potential NTHi benefit. Annual number of disease cases and costs (2010 Canadian dollars) were presented. RESULTS: In Canada, PCV13 was estimated to prevent more cases of disease (49,340 when considering both direct and indirect effects and 7,466 when considering direct effects only) than PCV10. This translated to population gains of 258 to 13,828 more quality-adjusted life-years when vaccinating with PCV13 versus PCV10. Annual direct medical costs (including the cost of vaccination) were estimated to be reduced by {\$}5.7 million to {\$}132.8 million when vaccinating with PCV13. Thus, PCV13 dominated PCV10, and sensitivity analyses showed PCV13 to always be dominant or cost-effective versus PCV10. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease in Canada, PCV13 is shown to be a cost-saving immunization program because it provides substantial public health and economic benefits relative to PCV10.},

abstract = {The surrounding capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae has been identified as a major virulence factor and is targeted by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV). However, nonencapsulated S. pneumoniae (non-Ec-Sp) have also been isolated globally, mainly in carriage studies. It is unknown if non-Ec-Sp evolve sporadically, if they have high antibiotic nonsusceptiblity rates and a unique, specific gene content. Here, whole-genome sequencing of 131 non-Ec-Sp isolates sourced from 17 different locations around the world was performed. Results revealed a deep-branching classic lineage that is distinct from multiple sporadic lineages. The sporadic lineages clustered with a previously sequenced, global collection of encapsulated S. pneumoniae (Ec-Sp) isolates while the classic lineage is comprised mainly of the frequently identified multilocus sequences types (STs) ST344 (n = 39) and ST448 (n = 40). All ST344 and nine ST448 isolates had high nonsusceptiblity rates to $\beta$-lactams and other antimicrobials. Analysis of the accessory genome reveals that the classic non-Ec-Sp contained an increased number of mobile elements, than Ec-Sp and sporadic non-Ec-Sp. Performing adherence assays to human epithelial cells for selected classic and sporadic non-Ec-Sp revealed that the presence of a integrative conjugative element (ICE) results in increased adherence to human epithelial cells (P = 0.005). In contrast, sporadic non-Ec-Sp lacking the ICE had greater growth in vitro possibly resulting in improved fitness. In conclusion, non-Ec-Sp isolates from the classic lineage have evolved separately. They have spread globally, are well adapted to nasopharyngeal carriage and are able to coexist with Ec-Sp. Due to continued use of PCV, non-Ec-Sp may become more prevalent.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive pneumococcal disease declined among children and adults after the introduction of the pediatric heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2000, but its effect on pneumococcal meningitis is unclear. METHODS: We examined trends in pneumococcal meningitis from 1998 through 2005 using active, population-based surveillance data from eight sites in the United States. Isolates were grouped into PCV7 serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F), PCV7-related serotypes (6A, 9A, 9L, 9N, 18A, 18B, 18F, 19B, 19C, 23A, and 23B), and non-PCV7 serotypes (all others). Changes in the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis were assessed against baseline values from 1998-1999. RESULTS: We identified 1379 cases of pneumococcal meningitis. The incidence declined from 1.13 cases to 0.79 case per 100,000 persons between 1998-1999 and 2004-2005 (a 30.1{\%} decline, P{\textless}0.001). Among persons younger than 2 years of age and those 65 years of age or older, the incidence decreased during the study period by 64.0{\%} and 54.0{\%}, respectively (P{\textless}0.001 for both groups). Rates of PCV7-serotype meningitis declined from 0.66 case to 0.18 case (a 73.3{\%} decline, P{\textless}0.001) among patients of all ages. Although rates of PCV7-related-serotype disease decreased by 32.1{\%} (P=0.08), rates of non-PCV7-serotype disease increased from 0.32 to 0.51 (an increase of 60.5{\%}, P{\textless}0.001). The percentages of cases from non-PCV7 serotypes 19A, 22F, and 35B each increased significantly during the study period. On average, 27.8{\%} of isolates were nonsusceptible to penicillin, but fewer isolates were nonsusceptible to chloramphenicol (5.7{\%}), meropenem (16.6{\%}), and cefotaxime (11.8{\%}). The proportion of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates decreased between 1998 and 2003 (from 32.0{\%} to 19.4{\%}, P=0.01) but increased between 2003 and 2005 (from 19.4{\%} to 30.1{\%}, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of pneumococcal meningitis have decreased among children and adults since PCV7 was introduced. Although the overall effect of the vaccine remains substantial, a recent increase in meningitis caused by non-PCV7 serotypes, including strains nonsusceptible to antibiotics, is a concern.},

abstract = {By use of multilocus sequence typing, Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates causing invasive disease (n=150) were compared with those from nasopharyngeal carriage (n=351) among children in Oxford. The prevalence of individual clones (sequence types) and serotypes among isolates from invasive disease was related to their prevalence in carriage, and an odds ratio (OR) for invasive disease was calculated for the major clones and serotypes. All major carried clones and serotypes caused invasive disease, although their ability to do so varied greatly. Thus, 2 serotype 14 clones were approximately 10-fold overrepresented among disease isolates, compared with carriage isolates, whereas a serotype 3 clone was approximately 10-fold underrepresented. The lack of heterogeneity between the ORs of different clones of the same serotype, and analysis of isolates of the same genotype, but different serotype, suggested that capsular serotype may be more important than genotype in the ability of pneumococci to cause invasive disease.},

abstract = {A surveillance of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia was conducted in Huntington, West Virginia, from 1978 to 1997 to investigate case-fatality rates, incidence of disease, capsular types, and antibiotic usage. Our study population comprised consecutive inpatients admitted to the hospitals in Huntington, West Virginia, and included 45 children younger than 15 years and 328 adults. All blood isolates were serotyped by capsular swelling procedures; clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome for all patients were abstracted from hospital charts. The overall case-fatality rate was 20.3{\%}, with most deaths occurring among adults older than 50 years. Case-fatality rates peaked at 37.7{\%} among patients 80 years of age and older. Only 1 of 45 (2.2{\%}) children died. Case-fatality rates declined in each successive 5-year period, from 30.2{\%} in 1978-1982 to 15.6{\%} in 1993-1997. In that same period, incidence rates increased severalfold among children younger than 4 years to 44.5 cases per 100,000 population and among adults 70 years and 80 years of age and older to 38.5 and 76.2 cases per 100,000, respectively. Of the 34 serotypes isolated, 10 accounted for two thirds of the cases of pneumonia: 1, 4, 9, 14, 3, 6, 12, 5, 23, and 19 (in rank order). Chronic renal disease and arteriosclerotic heart disease increased the risk of death. Treatment regimens that included a macrolide and a penicillin or cephalosporin resulted in the lowest case-fatality rate in adults older than 50 years: 6{\%} in 1993-1997. In conclusion, as bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia evolved over time, the case-fatality rate decreased, its incidence increased, predominant capsular types changed, and treatment regimens that included a macrolide resulted in the lowest fatality rates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and acute otitis media are two of the most common respiratory tract infections. The common pathogenic bacteria associated with these infections are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. With the recent widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, there is evidence that there is a shift of both the pneumococcal serotypes and the distribution of pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this article was to investigate whether the literature supports changes in pathogenicity of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and otitis media after widespread use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search of the literature was performed between 1995 and 2007. REVIEW METHODS: Literature review of changes in distribution of pathogens, resistance rates, and pneumococcal serotype changes before and after widespread use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. RESULTS: There is evidence that the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes has changed after the widespread use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. There appears to be both less invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal disease and with childhood immunization there also appears to be a protective effect on adults (herd immunity). Increases in nonvaccine serotypes, some with high levels of resistance are being identified in some communities. There is also growing evidence that there may be an increasing prevalence of Haemophilus influenzae in these infections. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has led to decreasing incidence of pneumococcal otitis media and likely also acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which may have implications for treatment recommendations for these infections.},

abstract = {The bacterial species Streptococcus pneumoniae consists of 90 immunologically distinct serotypes, of which some possess distinct epidemiological properties. Certain serotypes are much more likely to be associated with nasopharyngeal colonisation than to cause invasive disease. Compared with transient or infrequent colonisers, serotypes carried at high rates by young children may rapidly elicit age-associated natural immunity to invasive disease. Other serotypes seem to be of disproportionate importance as causes of disease in very young infants, in older children, in immunocompromised individuals, or in elderly people. Some serotypes seem to be associated with particular disease syndromes, such as complicated pneumonias in children, or with higher rates of hospitalisation in children or mortality in adults, or are consistently responsible for outbreaks in certain populations. Since pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are directed at specific serotypes, national immunisation advisory committees may wish to consider these serotype-specific properties when considering which vaccine formulation to introduce into a national programme.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among adults 50 years of age and older in the United States. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are efficacious against pneumococcal disease in children and may also offer advantages in adults. METHODS We performed a randomized, modified double-blind trial that compared a single dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in 831 pneumococcal vaccine naive adults 60–64 years of age. An additional group of 403 adults 50–59 years of age received open-label PCV13. Anti-pneumococcal opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers were measured at baseline, and at 1 month and 1 year after vaccination. RESULTS In the randomized trial, the month 1 post-vaccination OPA geometric mean titers in the PCV13 group were statistically significantly higher than in the PPSV23 group for 8 of the 12 serotypes common to both vaccines and for serotype 6A, a serotype unique to PCV13, and were comparable for the other 4 common serotypes. The immune response to PCV13 was generally greater in adults 50–59 years of age compared to adults 60–64 years of age. OPA titers declined from 1 month to 1 year after PCV13 administration but remained higher than pre-vaccination baseline titers. CONCLUSIONS PCV13 induces a greater functional immune response than PPSV23 for the majority of serotypes covered by PCV13, suggesting that PCV13 could offer immunological advantages over PPSV23 for prevention of vaccine-type pneumococcal infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) caused approximately 44000 US invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases in 2008. Antibiotic nonsusceptibility complicates IPD treatment. Using penicillin susceptibility breakpoints adopted in 2008, we evaluated antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD trends in light of the introductions of a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2000 and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2010. METHODS: IPD cases were defined by isolation of pneumococcus from a normally sterile site in individuals residing in Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) areas during 1998-2008. Pneumococci were serotyped and tested for antibiotic susceptibility using broth microdilution. RESULTS: During 1998-2008, ABCs identified 43198 IPD cases. Penicillin-nonsusceptible strains caused 6{\%}-14{\%} of IPD cases, depending on age. Between 1998-1999 and 2008, penicillin-nonsusceptible IPD rates declined 64{\%} for children aged {\textless}5 years (12.1-4.4 cases per 100000), and 45{\%} for adults aged ≥65 (4.8-2.6 cases per 100000). Rates of IPD nonsusceptible to multiple antibiotics mirrored these trends. During 2007-2008, serotypes in PCV13 but not PCV7 caused 78{\%}-97{\%} of penicillin-nonsusceptible IPD, depending on age. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD rates remain below pre-PCV7 rates for children {\textless}5 and adults ≥65 years old. PCV13 vaccines hold promise for further nonsusceptibility reductions.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is useful in assessing how robust an association is to potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding. This article introduces a new measure called the "E-value," which is related to the evidence for causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding. The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment-outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates. A large E-value implies that considerable unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. A small E-value implies little unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. The authors propose that in all observational studies intended to produce evidence for causality, the E-value be reported or some other sensitivity analysis be used. They suggest calculating the E-value for both the observed association estimate (after adjustments for measured confounders) and the limit of the confidence interval closest to the null. If this were to become standard practice, the ability of the scientific community to assess evidence from observational studies would improve considerably, and ultimately, science would be strengthened.},

The objectives are to describe the incidence of VT in Denmark during 1997-2011 from national register data, furthermore, to analyze the determinants for VT in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 (COPSAC2010) birth cohort. METHODS The incidence of VT in all children under 16 years from 1997-2011 were calculated in the Danish national registries. Determinants of VT were studied in the COPSAC2010 birth cohort of 700 children. RESULTS Nationwide the prevalence of VT was 24{\%} in children aged 0 to 3 three years, with a significant increase over the study period. For all children 0-15 years, the incidence of VT was 35/1,000. In the VT population, 57{\%} was male and 43{\%} females. In the COPSAC2010 birth cohort, the prevalence of VT during the first 3 years of life was 29{\%}. Determinants of VT were: maternal history of middle ear disease; aHR 2.07, 95{\%} CI [1.45-2.96] and siblings history of middle ear disease; aHR 3.02, [2.11-4.32]. Paternal history of middle ear disease, presence of older siblings in the home and diagnosis of persistent wheeze were significant in the univariate analysis but the association did not persist after adjustment. CONCLUSION The incidence of VT is still increasing in the youngest age group in Denmark, demonstrating the highest incidence recorded in the world. Family history of middle ear disease and older siblings are the main determinants for VT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To reduce excess morbidity and mortality of pneumonia and influenza (PI), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended the use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), and incrementally expanded the target group for annual influenza vaccination of healthy persons, to ultimately include all persons ≥6 months of age without contraindications as of the 2010-2011 influenza season. We aimed to capture broader epidemiologic changes by looking at PI collectively. METHODS: Using interrupted time series, we evaluated the changes in the rates of PI hospitalization and inpatient death across three periods defined according to the changes in vaccination policy. We assessed linear trends adjusting for seasonality, sex, and age group, allowing for differential impact across age groups. PI hospitalizations were defined as a principal diagnosis of PI, or a principal diagnosis of sepsis or respiratory failure, accompanied by a secondary diagnosis of PI. RESULTS: Overall annual rates of PI hospitalizations and inpatient deaths declined by 95 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI: 45-145) and by 4.4 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI: 0.9-7.8), respectively. This translates to 295,000 fewer PI hospitalizations and 13,600 fewer PI inpatient deaths than expected based on the average rates from 1996 through 1999. PI hospitalizations dropped the most among seniors aged 65+ by 487 per 100,000, followed by children aged {\textless}2, by 228 per 100,000. PI inpatient deaths declined most among seniors aged 65+, by 25.3 per 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative study, PI hospitalizations and inpatient deaths decreased in U.S. between 1996 and 2011. There is a temporal association with the introduction and widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, and the expansion of the target group for annual influenza vaccination to include all persons ≥6 months of age, while it is difficult to attribute these changes directly to specific vaccines used in this era.},

Our current aim is to describe later trends after PCV7 and early trends after PCV13 vaccine introduction in 2010. METHODS:: The Calgary Area Streptococcus pneumoniae Epidemiology Research (CASPER) team conducted 10 point-prevalence surveys of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in healthy children aged 12 and 18 months and 4.5 years bi-annually from 2003-2005 (previously reported) and annually in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2012. RESULTS:: For surveys conducted in 2010-2012, the proportion colonized was 13.2{\%} compared with 19.9{\%} in surveys conducted in 2003-2006 (P{\textless}0.001). Vaccination with 2 or more doses of PCV7 or PCV13, older age, and recent antibiotic use reduced the odds of colonization with any pneumococcus. By 2012, 94{\%} of all isolates were non-vaccine serotypes with 11A, 15A/B/C, 22F, 23A/B, 35B/F representing 75{\%} of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS:: Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization has changed profoundly since the introduction of conjugate vaccines and overall colonization by pneumococcus has declined in recent years. By 2012, non-vaccine serotypes have nearly completely replaced vaccine serotypes. The impact on clinical disease remains to be seen.},

abstract = {Introduction of Pneumococcal Conjugated Vaccines (PCV) in national immunization programs have been successful in reducing the number of invasive and lower respiratory pneumococcal infections. The impact of the vaccines on upper respiratory infections caused by pneumococci is less clear although these account for most pneumococcal infections. In this study, we used likely proxies for respiratory infections in children, such as antibiotic use and ventilation tube insertions (VTI), to estimate the impact of the vaccine on a national level. The study was designed as a population-based retrospective observational study, comparing trends in the incidence rate of antibiotic prescriptions and VTIs in the period 2000-2014, where PCV7 was introduced in 2007 and PCV13 in 2010. The introduction of PCV7 and PCV13 correlated with changes in the incidence rate from an almost steady increase in prescription of antibiotics in the pre-PCV period to a decreasing incidence for all children age 0-15years. The 2.4 DDD per person year in 2014 was at almost the same level of antibiotic use as in 2000 at 2.3 DDD per person year. Similar patterns were observed in the mostly vaccinated age groups below 5years of age. For VTI we observed a decreasing incidence rate in the years following introduction of PCV13 ending with a slightly higher incidence at 35 per 1000 person years in 2014 compared to 31 in year 2000. We conclude that the steady increase in antibiotic use and VTI in the pre-PCV period have been partially reversed to near year 2000 levels after the introduction of PCV. This indicates that implementation of pneumococcal vaccines in the Childhood Vaccination Programme has likely reduced the incidence of upper respiratory diseases due to pneumococci in Denmark.},

abstract = {In the 12 decades that will have elapsed between the first isolation of the pneumococcus and the coming millennium, much of fundamental biologic importance has been learned from the study of this bacterium and the diseases it causes. Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with the development of Gram's stain, the Quellung reaction, and many of the fundamentals of immunology. It has also played a significant role in the history of antimicrobial therapy. After a transitory period of euphoria engendered by the improved prognosis of pneumococcal pneumonia resulting from therapeutic advances, recognition that the newer treatments could not bring about the recovery of those sustaining early irreversible physiologic injury led to renewed interest in immunoprophylaxis. Added impetus to this approach has been fostered by the recent rapid increase in the number of pneumococcal isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents and in the magnitude of their resistance.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine changes in antibiotic-dispensing rates among children in 3 health plans located in New England [A], the Mountain West [B], and the Midwest [C] regions of the United States. METHODS: Pharmacy and outpatient claims from September 2000 to August 2010 were used to calculate rates of antibiotic dispensing per person-year for children aged 3 months to 18 years. Differences in rates by year, diagnosis, and health plan were tested by using Poisson regression. The data were analyzed to determine whether there was a change in the rate of decline over time. RESULTS: Antibiotic use in the 3- to ,24-month age group varied at baseline according to health plan (A: 2.27, B: 1.40, C: 2.23 antibiotics per person-year; P , .001). The downward trend in antibiotic dispensing slowed, stabilized, or reversed during this 10-year period. In the 3- to ,24-month age group, we observed 5.0{\%}, 9.3{\%}, and 7.2{\%} annual declines early in the decade in the 3 plans, respectively. These dropped to 2.4{\%}, 2.1{\%}, and 0.5{\%} annual declines by the end of the decade. Third-generation cephalosporin use for otitis media increased 1.6-, 15-, and 5.5-fold in plans A, B, and C in young children. Similar attenuation of decline in antibiotic use and increases in use of broad- spectrum agents were seen in other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic dispensing for children may have reached a new plateau. Along with identifying best practices in low-prescribing areas, decreasing broad-spectrum use for particular conditions should be a continuing focus of intervention efforts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Australian Aboriginal children experience earlier, more frequent and more severe otitis media, particularly in remote communities, than non-Aboriginal children. Insertion of ventilation tubes is the main surgical procedure for otitis media. Our aim was to quantify inequalities in ventilation tube insertion (VTI) procedures between Australian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children, and to explore the influence of birth characteristics, socioeconomic background and geographical remoteness on this inequality. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study using linked hospital and mortality data from July 2000 to December 2008. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A whole-of-population cohort of 653 550 children (16 831 Aboriginal and 636 719 non-Aboriginal) born in a New South Wales hospital between 1 July 2000 and 31 December 2007 was included in the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURE First VTI procedure. RESULTS VTI rates were lower in Aboriginal compared with non-Aboriginal children (incidence rate (IR), 4.3/1000 person-years; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 3.8 to 4.8 vs IR 5.8/1000 person-years; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 5.7 to 5.8). Overall, Aboriginal children were 28{\{}{\%}{\}} less likely than non-Aboriginal children to have ventilation tubes inserted (age-adjusted and sex-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) 0.72; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 0.64 to 0.80). After adjusting additionally for geographical remoteness, Aboriginal children were 19{\{}{\%}{\}} less likely to have ventilation tubes inserted (age-adjusted and sex-adjusted RR 0.81; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 0.73 to 0.91). After adjusting separately for private patient/health insurance status and area socioeconomic status, there was no significant difference (age-adjusted and sex-adjusted RR 0.96; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 0.86 to 1.08 and RR 0.93; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 0.83 to 1.04, respectively). In the fully adjusted model, there were no significant differences in VTI rates between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children (RR 1.06; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 0.94 to 1.19). CONCLUSIONS Despite a much higher prevalence of otitis media, Aboriginal children were less likely to receive VTI procedures than their non-Aboriginal counterparts; this inequality was largely explained by differences in socioeconomic status and geographical remoteness.},

METHODS: A Dutch surveillance network of child day-care centers (DCCs) prospectively reported on infectious disease episodes and related use of health care among their child population on a daily basis from March 2010 to March 2012.

RESULTS: Gastroenteritis (387 per 1000 child-years) and influenza-like illness (247 per 1000 child-years) were the most frequently reported infectious diseases. DCCs reported these infectious diseases to occur twice as often among children aged 0-2 years compared with children aged 2-4 years. Antibiotic treatment was required in 6{\%}, a general practitioner visit in 29{\%} and hospitalization in 2{\%} of infectious disease episodes. DCC incidences of gastroenteritis and influenza-like illness requiring children to visit a general practitioner were approximately twice as high as general population estimates for this age group. Part of the DCCs indicated to not always wash the hands of children before eating (34{\%}) or after a toilet visit (15{\%}) or to not always clean the toilet and kitchen areas (17{\%}) on a daily basis.

CONCLUSION: The infectious disease risk associated with child day-care attendance is substantial, particularly among the very young attendees, in excess of general population estimates for this age group and potentially partly preventable.},

Of the several viruses that cause the disease, the role of rhinoviruses is most prominent. About a quarter of all colds are still without proven cause, and the recent discovery of human metapneumovirus suggests that other viruses could remain undiscovered. Research into the inflammatory mechanisms of the common cold has elucidated the complexity of the virus-host relation. Increasing evidence is also available for the central role of viruses in predisposing to complications. New antivirals for the treatment of colds are being developed, but optimum use of these agents would require rapid detection of the specific virus causing the infection. Although vaccines against many respiratory viruses could also become available, the ultimate prevention of the common cold seems to remain a distant aim.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In late 2007, some Swedish County Councils started 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) implementation for children, and PCV7 was included in the national immunization program in 2009. By 2010, both PCV10 and PCV13 were licensed, and the selection of vaccine was subject to County Councils tenders. This study investigated the impact of the order of PCV introduction into vaccination programs on the incidence of all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations in children {\textless}2 years-old. METHODS Using population-based data from the publicly available National Inpatient Registry, the incidence of inpatient pneumonia (ICD-10 J12-J18) hospitalizations by County Councils among children {\textless}2 years old was identified between 1998 and 2012. Incidence rate ratios (IRR; 95{\%} CI) were calculated during the nationwide implementation of PCV7 and then between County Councils, as based on the higher-valent vaccine chosen for a program. RESULTS There was a lower risk of all-cause pneumonia hospitalization among {\textless}2 year-old children following the introduction of PCV7, as compared to the pre-PCV7 period (0.77; 0.63-0.93). A decreased risk of all-cause pneumonia was also observed in the County Councils that followed the order PCV7 then PCV13 (0.82; 0.66-1.01), while no trend was observed in County Councils with a program in the order PCV7 then PCV10 (1.03; 0.82-1.30). When comparing the higher-valent vaccines, there was a 21{\%} (0.79; 0.66-0.96) lower risk for childhood pneumonia hospitalization in County Councils finally using PCV13 as compared to the experience in County Councils that ultimately adopted PCV10. CONCLUSIONS Among children {\textless}2 years-old, all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations were significantly reduced by 23{\%} one to two years after introduction of PCV7 vaccination in Sweden. In those County Councils that next introduced PCV13, a further decline in all-cause pneumonia hospitalization was observed, in contrast to those County Councils that followed with PCV10; this 21{\%} lower risk for childhood pneumonia hospitalization was statistically significant.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: A conjugate vaccine targeting 7 pneumococcal serotypes was licensed for young children in 2000. In contrast to the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine used in adults, the 7-valent conjugate vaccine affects pneumococcal carriage and transmission. Early after its introduction, incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease declined among older adults, a group at high risk for pneumococcal disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine among adults aged 50 years or older whether incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, disease characteristics, or the spectrum of patients acquiring these illnesses have changed over the 4 years since pneumococcal conjugate vaccine licensure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Population-based surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in 8 US geographic areas (total population, 18,813,000), 1998-2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease by pneumococcal serotype and other characteristics; frequency among case patients of comorbid conditions and other factors influencing mortality. RESULTS: Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among adults aged 50 years or older declined 28{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -31{\%} to -24{\%}), from 40.8 cases/100,000 in 1998-1999 to 29.4 in 2002-2003. Among those aged 65 years or older, the 2002-2003 rate (41.7 cases/100,000) was lower than the Healthy People 2010 goal (42 cases/100,000). Among adults aged 50 years or older, incidence of disease caused by the 7 conjugate vaccine serotypes declined 55{\%} (95{\%} CI, -58{\%} to -51{\%}) from 22.4 to 10.2 cases/100,000. In contrast, disease caused by any of the 16 serotypes only in polysaccharide vaccine did not change, and disease caused by serotypes not in either vaccine increased somewhat, from 6.0 to 6.8 cases/100,000 (13{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 1{\%} to 27{\%}). Between 1998-1999 and 2002-2003, the proportion of case-patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection increased from 1.7{\%} (47/2737) to 5.6{\%} (124/2231) (P{\textless}.001), and those with any comorbid condition that is an indication for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination increased from 62.3{\%} (1842/2955) to 72.0{\%} (1721/2390) (P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that use of conjugate vaccine in children has substantially benefited older adults. However, persons with certain comorbid conditions may benefit less than healthier persons from the indirect effects of the new vaccine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to cause a variety of common clinical syndromes, despite vaccination programs for both adults and children. The total U.S. burden of pneumococcal disease is unknown. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree-based model to estimate U.S. healthcare utilization and costs of pneumococcal disease in 2004. Data were obtained from the 2004-2005 National (Hospital) Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (outpatient visits, antibiotics) and the National Hospital Discharge Survey (hospitalization rates), and CDC surveillance data. Other assumptions regarding the incidence of each syndrome due to pneumococcus, expected health outcomes, and healthcare utilization were derived from literature and expert opinion. Healthcare and time costs used 2007 dollars. RESULTS: We estimate that, in 2004, pneumococcal disease caused 4.0 million illness episodes, 22,000 deaths, 445,000 hospitalizations, 774,000 emergency department visits, 5.0 million outpatient visits, and 4.1 million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. Direct medical costs totaled {\$}3.5 billion. Pneumonia (866,000 cases) accounted for 22{\%} of all cases and 72{\%} of pneumococcal costs. In contrast, acute otitis media and sinusitis (1.5 million cases each) comprised 75{\%} of cases but only 16{\%} of direct medical costs. Patients ≥ 65 years old, accounted for most serious cases and the majority of direct medical costs ({\$}1.8 billion in healthcare costs annually). In this age group, pneumonia caused 242,000 hospitalizations, 1.4 million hospital days, 194,000 emergency department visits, 374,000 outpatient visits, and 16,000 deaths. However, if work loss and productivity are considered, the cost of pneumococcal disease among younger working adults (18-{\textless}50) nearly equaled those ≥ 65. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal disease remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality even in the era of routine pediatric and adult vaccination. Continued efforts are warranted to reduce serious pneumococcal disease, especially adult pneumonia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To update cost effectiveness estimates for the four dose (3+1) schedule of the seven valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV-7) in the Netherlands and to explore the impact on cost effectiveness of reduced dose schedules and implementation of 10 valent and 13 valent pneumococcal vaccines (PCV-10 and PCV-13).

DESIGN: Economic evaluation comparing PCV-7, PCV-10, and PCV-13 with no vaccination using a decision tree analytic model built from data in previous studies.

SETTING: The Netherlands. Population A cohort of 180,000 newborns followed until 5 years of age.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs; gains in life years and quality adjusted life years (QALYs); and incremental cost effectiveness ratios.

RESULTS: Under base case assumptions-that is, assuming a five year protective period of the vaccine and no assumed net indirect effects (herd protection minus serotype replacement) among children aged over 5 years-vaccination with PVC-7 in a four dose (3+1) schedule was estimated to prevent 71 and 5778 cases of invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease, respectively, in children aged up to 5 years. This corresponds with a total net gain of 173 life years or 277 QALYs. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PCV-7 was estimated at euro113,891 ( pound98,300; {\$}145,000) per QALY, well over the ratio of euro50,000 per QALY required for PCV-7 to be regarded as potentially cost effective. A three dose (2+1) schedule of PCV-7 reduced the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to euro82,975 per QALY. For various assumptions and including 10{\%} of the maximum net indirect effects among individuals aged 5 years and over, PCV-10 and PCV-13 had incremental cost effectiveness ratios ranging from euro31,250 to euro52,947 per QALY.

CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch infant vaccination programme of four doses of PCV-7 is not cost effective because of increases in invasive disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes, which reduces the overall direct effects of vaccination and offsets potential positive herd protection benefits in unvaccinated individuals. The 10 valent and 13 valent pneumococcal vaccines could have better net health benefits than PCV-7 through less replacement disease and increased herd protection. Both these effects could substantially reduce the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to possibly acceptable levels, if total programme costs can be lowered by reduced schedules, reductions in vaccine prices, or both.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the costs and clinical benefits of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) administered annually to the 65-year-old cohort in Spain versus the alternative of not vaccinating patients and treating them only when infected.

METHODS: Cases of pneumococcal disease avoided were calculated through a dynamic model based on the work of Anderson and May (1999). Sixty-six percent of the 65-year-old cohort was assumed to have been vaccinated with one PCV13 dose (304,492 subjects). Base-case estimated vaccine effectiveness and serotype coverage were 58{\%} and 60{\%}, respectively. Disease-related costs were calculated based on published data.

RESULTS: Over the 5-year period, a total of 125,906 cases of pneumococcal disease would be avoided. Net savings of €102 million would be obtained. The cost-saving distribution was not homogeneous, starting in the 2nd year and increasing through the 5th. To demonstrate model robustness, an additional scenario analysis was performed using extreme values of model parameters (vaccination programme coverage, vaccine effectiveness, discount rate and disease costs). Under those scenarios, net savings were always achieved.

CONCLUSIONS: Based on the assumptions of the model, the 65-year-cohort pneumococcal vaccination campaign appears to be a cost-saving intervention in the Spanish population under different scenarios.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have demonstrated a reduction for otitis media (OM) following the introduction of seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), but this has not been evaluated in the United Kingdom (UK). Moreover, there are limited data on any additional impact of PCV13 introduction in 2010. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study to investigate the trends in OM incidence and associated antibiotic prescriptions in children aged {\textless}10 year-olds during 2002-2012 using a national primary care database. Three time-periods were defined to estimate monthly incidence: pre-PCV7 (January 2002-August 2006), post-PCV7 (September 2007-March 2010), and post-PCV13 (April 2011-December 2012). Results: Overall annual OM incidence declined by 51.3{\%} from 135.8 episodes/1000 person-years in 2002 to 66.1 episodes/1000 person-years in 2012; antibiotic prescription rates for OM declined by 72.9{\%} from 57.9 prescriptions/1000 person-years to 15.7 prescriptions/1000 person-years, respectively. PCV7 introduction was associated with significant decline in OM rates across all age-groups (21.8{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 20.2-23.4), including {\textless}2 year-olds (19.8{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 16.0-23.5{\%}); 2-4 year-olds (23.0{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 20.4-25.4{\%}) and 5-9 year-olds (20.2{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 17.6-22.7{\%}). There was an additional significant reduction in OM (18.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 16.7-20.2{\%}) and associated antibiotic prescribing (12.2{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 8.6-15.6{\%}) after the introduction of PCV13 across all age-groups. Conclusion: The introduction of PCV7 was associated with a 22{\%} significant reductions in OM in children aged {\textless}10 year-olds with an additional 19{\%} reductions after PCV13 introduction. These declines are equivalent to 592,000 and 15,700 fewer consultations and OM-related hospitalizations, respectively, in England and Wales every year. Although the continuing decline in OM rates in our study suggests that further reduction may continue to occur, it is important to monitor long-term trends in all pneumococcal diseases, including OM and pneumonia, because of increasing replacement of non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes in carriage and disease.},

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) targeted against a limited number of serotypes have nonetheless revealed an impressive impact on each manifestation of pneumococcal disease. At the same time, growing evidence of significant non-vaccine type (NVT) replacement disease following implementation of infant PCV programs has raised questions about the long-term viability of PCV immunization strategies and how to optimize PCV formulations. We discuss here theoretical and practical considerations regarding serotype replacement, and provide a snapshot of the most important NVT types seen to date after implementation of the 2 higher-valent PCVs.},

abstract = {Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis for which antibiotics are prescribed in children. However, due to their widespread use, we are witnesses to increased development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity of antibiotic treatment in patients with AOM. Our study included 314 children, aged between 2 months and 6 years. Children were divided into two groups: the first group included children with less severe forms of AOM, who received symptomatic therapy and " wait-and-see" approach (237 children); the second group presented with purulent ear infection and received antibiotic treatment from the beginning (77 children). After symptomatic therapy, resolution of the disease, without use of any antibiotics, was established in 61{\%} of patients, compared to the overall sample of children with AOM. None of the children developed complications that would require surgical treatment. In the second group of children, receiving antibiotics, almost the same therapeutic effects (80{\%}) were achieved with the use of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefixime, while the worst results were obtained after using azithromycin.The wait-and-see approach is recommended in forms of AOM without serious signs and symptoms, because it significantly reduces the use of antibiotics and their potential adverse effects. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To determine whether we could increase adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations with well-accepted approaches to improving quality of care and adherence to the CDC recommendations resulted in improved outcomes for acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS A cluster randomization study was conducted in 12 pediatric practices (6 intervention and 6 control sites). The main outcome measures were adherence to the CDC recommendations (modified to include 2 additional antimicrobial agents) and a subsequent antibiotic prescription for AOM within 30 days after diagnosis. RESULTS Of 3152 patients referred to research assistants, 2584 (82{\%}) were eligible. Of those eligible, 1368 (99{\%}) of 1382 at the intervention sites and 1138 (99{\%}) of 1146 at the control sites consented to participate. Rates of adherence to the CDC recommendations were not significantly higher at the intervention sites than at the control sites, for initial enrollment episodes (78.2{\%} vs 70.6{\%}) or second episodes (62.6{\%} vs 59.9{\%}). After controlling for clustering according to site and covariates, children who were not treated in adherence to the CDC recommendations for both episodes had 1.60 times the odds of a subsequent prescription within 12 days, compared with those treated in adherence at both episodes. CONCLUSIONS Despite using evidence-based approaches that are known to influence physician behavior, we were unable to increase adherence to the CDC recommendations for treatment of AOM. However, we did establish that prescription of antimicrobial therapy consistent with the CDC recommendations for a second episode of AOM was associated with improved outcomes, measured as the need for subsequent antibiotic prescription. Because of the selection of resistant otopathogens, adherence to the CDC recommendations is likely more important in subsequent episodes of AOM than in the initial episode.},

abstract = {This study examined the roles of two different diagnostic approaches to children with fever of unknown origin in determining the patterns of pneumococcal bacteraemia in two Spanish regions by comparing their main epidemiologic characteristics. Whereas a blood culture is routinely obtained in this setting in Navarre, this is not generally the case in Majorca. Additionally, the potential role of antibiotic consumption in each region was also analysed. Cumulative incidences in children under the age of 14 years were 26.6 per 100,000 child-years in Navarre (121.1 in children {\textless}2 years of age) and 7.3 per 100,000 child-years in Majorca (33.3 in children {\textless}2 years of age). In contrast, the incidences per 1,000 blood cultures were similar in both regions. The relative risks of occult bacteraemia, bacteraemic pneumonia and meningitis among the children of Navarre compared to Majorcan children were 11.8, 2.6 and 0.8, respectively. The risk for less virulent (vaccine serotypes plus 6A, 19A and 23A) and for more virulent serotypes (1 and 7) was 4.9 and 3.1 times higher in Navarre, respectively. The number of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) doses administered between 2003 and 2004 were also higher in Navarre. Conversely, antibiotic resistance and paediatric prescriptions for broad-spectrum antibiotics were greater in Majorca. Although the most salient differences between both regions, including the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Navarre, appeared to be confounded by the higher frequency of blood cultures taken there, certain differences in serotype composition may be explained by the higher antibiotic consumption in Majorca.},

abstract = {Objective Pneumococcus is a known cause of meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, and acute otitis media in children and adults globally. Two new vaccines for children have the potential to prevent illness, disability, and death, but these vaccines are expensive. The Croatian Ministry of Health has considered introducing the vaccine in the past, but requires economic evidence to ensure that the limited funds available for health care will be used in the most effective way. MethodologyCroatia appointed a multidisciplinary team of experts to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) into the national routine child immunization program. Both 10-valent and 13-valent PCV (PCV10 and PCV13) were compared to a scenario assuming no vaccination. The TRIVAC decision-support model was used to estimate cost-effectiveness over the period 2014-2033. We used national evidence on demographics, pneumococcal disease incidence and mortality, the age distribution of disease in children, health service utilization, vaccine coverage, vaccine timeliness, and serotype coverage. Vaccine effectiveness was based on evidence from the scientific literature. Detailed health care costs were not available from the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance at the time of the analysis so assumptions and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates for Croatia were used. We assumed a three-dose primary vaccination schedule, and an initial price of US{\$} 30 per dose for PCV10 and US{\$} 35 per dose for PCV13. We ran univariate sensitivity analyses and multivariate scenario analyses. ResultsEither vaccine is estimated to prevent approximately 100 hospital admissions and one death each year in children younger than five in Croatia. Compared to no vaccine, the discounted cost-effectiveness of either vaccine is estimated to be around US{\$} 69,000-77,000 per disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted over the period 2014-2033 (from the government or societal perspective). Only two alternative scenarios were borderline cost-effective (US{\$} per DALY averted less than 3. ??. GDP per capita of approximately US{\$} 40,000). The first was a scenario based primarily on the WHO 2008 pneumococcal disease burden estimates for Croatia. The second was a scenario that assumed a fairly dramatic drop in the price of the vaccine over the period. Both vaccines would need to be priced at approximately US{\$} 20 per dose or less to be considered cost-effective under base-case assumptions. PCV10 would be more cost-effective than PCV13 with base-case assumptions, but this is sensitive to the price of each vaccine. ConclusionBased on estimated health and economic benefits in children alone, PCV is unlikely to be cost-effective in Croatia. Both vaccines would need to be priced at less than US{\$} 20 per dose to be considered cost-effective for children. Further analyses should be conducted to estimate the health and economic burden of pneumococcal disease in older age groups, and to assess the influence on cost-effectiveness results when short-term and long-term indirect effects are included for older individuals. While there are important uncertainties around the price and effectiveness of both vaccines, our analysis suggests there is insufficient evidence to warrant a significant difference in the price of the two vaccines.},

A literature search was performed using the search terms vaccine; immunization; antimicrobial; antibiotic; influenza; pneumococcal; haemophilus; meningococcal in MEDLINE (1948-May 2012), EMBASE (1980-May 2012), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2012), Google, and Google Scholar. Identified clinical or epidemiological studies were included if antimicrobial utilization was listed as a reported outcome. Seven articles (three randomized controlled trials and four epidemiological studies) were identified and included in the review. These studies reported outcomes associated with pneumococcal and influenza immunization programs. All studies reported decreased antibiotic use associated with initiation of immunization programs or increased uptake of available vaccines. Large-scale epidemiological studies confirm population-wide decreases observed from short-term randomized controlled trials. Antibiotic reductions ranged from 5 to 10{\%} in randomized controlled trials to relative reductions of 64{\%} in epidemiological studies. These findings suggest that immunization programs may reduce antibiotic utilization. As such, vaccination status queries and updates should become part of routine care for both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Immunization programs should be considered as part of institution-wide antimicrobial stewardship programs.},

Some vaccines already in use, such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, have had an effect on these successful clones, but at the same time have allowed for the expansion and resistance evolution of previously minor clones not covered by the vaccine. Since resistance frequently is horizontally transferred it will be difficult to generate a vaccine that covers all possible genetic lineages prone to develop resistance unless the vaccine target(s) is absolutely necessary for spread and/or disease development. Targeting the resistance mechanism itself by a vaccine is an interesting but hitherto unexplored approach.},

abstract = {Enhanced surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was carried out in all Australian states and territories in 2006 with comprehensive comparative data available since 2002. There were 1,445 cases of IPD notified to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System in Australia in 2006; a notification rate of 7 cases per 100,000 population. The rates varied between states and territories and by geographical region with the highest rates in the Northern Territory, the jurisdiction with the largest proportion of Indigenous people. Invasive pneumococcal disease was reported most frequently in those aged 85 years or over (30.8 cases per 100,000 population) and in children aged one year (26.5 cases per 100,000 population). There were 130 deaths attributed to IPD resulting in an overall case fatality rate of 9{\%}. The overall rate of IPD in Indigenous Australians was 4.3 times the rate in non-indigenous Australians. The rate of IPD in the under two years population continued to fall in 2006, but the rate in Indigenous children (73 cases per 100,000 population) was significantly greater than in non-Indigenous children (21 cases per 100,000 population). The rates of disease caused by serotypes in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) decreased between 2002 and 2006 by 78{\%} in children aged under two years as a result of the introduction of a universal childhood 7vPCV immunisation program. Significant decreases in IPD caused by 7vPCV serotypes also occurred in the 2-14 years and 65 years or over age groups. Rates of disease caused by non-7vPCV in the same periods were little changed. Serotypes were identified in 94{\%} of all notified cases, with 43{\%} of disease caused by serotypes in the 7vPCV and 85{\%} caused by serotypes in the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (23vPPV). The number of invasive pneumococcal isolates with reduced penicillin susceptibility remains low and reduced susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins is rare.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of pneumonia and sinusitis. Pneumonia kills {\textgreater}1 million children annually, and sinusitis is a potentially serious pediatric disease that increases the risk of orbital and intracranial complications. Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is effective against invasive pneumococcal disease, its effectiveness against pneumonia is less consistent, and its effect on sinusitis is not known. We compared hospitalization rates due to sinusitis, pneumonia, and empyema before and after sequential introduction of PCV7 and PCV13. METHOD All children 0 to {\textless}18 years old hospitalized for sinusitis, pneumonia, or empyema in Stockholm County, Sweden, from 2003 to 2012 were included in a population-based study of hospital registry data on hospitalizations due to sinusitis, pneumonia, or empyema. Trend analysis, incidence rates, and rate ratios (RRs) were calculated comparing July 2003 to June 2007 with July 2008 to June 2012, excluding the year of PCV7 introduction. RESULTS Hospitalizations for sinusitis decreased significantly in children aged 0 to {\textless}2 years, from 70 to 24 cases per 100 000 population (RR = 0.34, P {\textless} .001). Hospitalizations for pneumonia decreased significantly in children aged 0 to {\textless}2 years, from 450 to 366 per 100 000 population (RR = 0.81, P {\textless} .001) and in those aged 2 to {\textless}5 years from 250 to 212 per 100 000 population (RR = 0.85, P = .002). Hospitalization for empyema increased nonsignificantly. Trend analyses showed increasing hospitalization for pneumonia in children 0 to {\textless}2 years before intervention and confirmed a decrease in hospitalizations for sinusitis and pneumonia in children aged 0 to {\textless}5 years after intervention. CONCLUSIONS PCV7 and PCV13 vaccination led to a 66{\%} lower risk of hospitalization for sinusitis and 19{\%} lower risk of hospitalization for pneumonia in children aged 0 to {\textless}2 years, in a comparison of 4 years before and 4 years after vaccine introduction.},

Infants in South Korea had the highest rate of antimicrobial consumption, with 3.41 prescribed courses per child-year during the first 2 years of life. This compares with 1.6 in Lazio, Italy; 1.4 in Pedianet, Italy; 1.5 in Spain; 1.1 in the US; 1.0 in Germany; and 0.5 courses per child-year in Norway. Of antimicrobial prescriptions written in Norway, 64.8{\%} were for first-line penicillins, compared with 38.2{\%} in Germany, 31.8{\%} in the US, 27.7{\%} in Spain, 25.1{\%} in the Italian Pedianet population, 9.8{\%} in South Korea, and 8{\%} in the Italian Lazio population. CONCLUSIONS We found substantial differences of up to 7.5-fold in pediatric antimicrobial use across several industrialized countries from Europe, Asia, and North America. These data reinforce the need to develop strategies to decrease the unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents.},

abstract = {Background Increasing concerns about antibiotic resistance and microbiome disruption have stimulated interest in describing antibiotic consumption in young children. Young children are an age group for whom antibiotics are frequently prescribed. Objectives To describe community antibiotic dispensing during the first 5 years of life in a large, socioeconomically and ethnically diverse cohort of children, and to determine how antibiotic dispensing varied between population subgroups. Methods This study was performed within the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal cohort study ( www.growingup.co.nz ) with linkage to national administrative antibiotic dispensing data. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariable associations were determined. Results The 5581 cohort children received 53 052 antibiotic courses, of which 54{\%} were amoxicillin. By age 5 years, 97{\%} of children had received one or more antibiotic courses, and each child had received a median of eight antibiotic courses (IQR 4-13). The mean incidence of antibiotic dispensing was 1.9 courses/child/year. Multivariable negative binomial regression showed that Māori and Pacific children received more antibiotic courses than European children, as did children in the most-deprived compared with the least-deprived areas. A distinct seasonal pattern was noted. Conclusions This study provided a detailed description of antibiotic dispensing within a large and diverse child cohort. Antibiotic exposure was near universal by age 5 years. The predominance of amoxicillin use and the seasonal pattern suggest much antibiotic use may have been for self-limiting respiratory infections. There is a need for safe and effective interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for New Zealand children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The antibody response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in infants is variable. Factors responsible for this variability have not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate whether pneumococcal carriage around the time of the first dose of 7-valent PCV (PCV7) affects serotype-specific immunologic response. METHODS: Healthy 2-month old infants were randomized to receive 2 (at the ages of 4 and 6 months) or 3 (at the ages of 2, 4, and 6 months) PCV7 doses and a booster dose (at the age of 12 months). Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens were obtained for culture shortly before the first PCV7 dose. Serotype-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels were measured at ages 2, 7, and 13 months. RESULTS: Of 545 children studied, 332 received a booster dose. The most common serotypes carried around the time of the first PCV7 dose were 6B (n = 37), 19F (n = 22), and 23F (n = 14). In carriers before the first dose, the IgG response to the carried serotype after 2 or 3 doses was significantly lower than in noncarriers. In contrast, response to the noncarried serotypes was not affected. Although all children responded to the booster dose, the response to the originally carried serotype was generally lower. CONCLUSIONS: Serotype-specific hyporesponsiveness to PCV7 after pneumococcal carriage in infants is demonstrated for the first time. This phenomenon was common, lasted for at least several months, and was only partially overcome by the 12-month booster. TRIAL REGISTRATION: isrctn.org identifier: ISRCTN28445844.},

METHODS: We performed a 10-year prospective study including all children with culture-proven IPD admitted to Sant Joan de Deu Hospital, a children's center in the southern area of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. PCV7 was introduced in June 2001, and the current estimate of PCV7 coverage is 45{\%}-50{\%}. RESULTS: Comparing the prevaccine period (1997-2001) with the vaccine period (2002-2006), among children aged {\textless}2 years, the rate of IPD increased from 32.4 episodes per 100,000 population to 51.3 episodes per 100,000 population (an increase of 58{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2{\%}-145{\%}), and among children aged 2-4 years, the rate increased from 11.3 episodes per 100,000 population to 26.5 episodes per 100,000 population (an increase of 135{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 31{\%}-320{\%}). At clinical presentation, the rate of pneumonia and/or empyema among children aged {\textless}5 years increased from 3.6 episodes per 100,000 population to 15.1 episodes per 100,000 population (an increase of 320{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 98{\%}-790{\%}). These increased rates of IPD were caused by non-PCV7 serotypes, which represented 38{\%} and 72{\%} of infecting serotypes in the prevaccine and vaccine periods, respectively (P=.001). Penicillin resistance decreased from 48{\%} in the prevaccine period to 27{\%} in the vaccine period (P=.005). In the vaccine period, there was an emergence of previously established virulent clones of non-PCV7 serotypes 1 and 5. There was also an increase in the prevalence of serotypes 19A and 6A expressed with different clonal types, including Spain(23F)-1 and Spain(6B)-2. CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of PCV7 for children, there has been an emergence of IPD caused by virulent clones of non-PCV7 serotypes that has been associated with significant clinical changes and a decrease in antibiotic resistance.},

Vaccine (0.5 ml) was administered subcutaneously; a dose contained 25 micrograms of each serotype. The incidence of otitis media due to "target" serotypes was determined in both groups. There were not significant differences between vaccines and controls in either the incidence or etiology of episodes of otitis media before immunization. During a two-year follow-up, no significant difference was observed regarding the incidence of episodes due to "target" serotypes in infants who were immunized after 12 months of age. However, of 66 control infants immunized before 12 months of age, 22 experienced 33 pneumococcal episodes due to a "target" serotype, whereas only 13 of 67 vaccines accounted for 22 such episodes. Among infants who had two or fewer episodes before immunization, four vaccines and 13 controls continued to have episodes of otitis media and became "otitis prone," i.e., six or more episodes (chi 2 = 4.84; P = 0.05). Low levels of serum antibody were not protective, and in one case a level of 609 ng of antibody nitrogen/ml of middle ear effusion was not protective. Thus, although the vaccine may be associated with a lower incidence of otitis media, the results of this study do not show a statistically significant efficacy of the vaccine.},

DESIGN: Population-based case-series. SETTING: Group Health Cooperative, a health maintenance organization in Washington State. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older with a first episode of pneumococcal bacteremia between 1988 and 2002. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, vaccination status, and clinical outcomes, including death, hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and postdischarge care, were assessed using chart review. RESULTS: The mean age of the 200 elderly patients with pneumococcal bacteremia was 78; 61{\%} were female. Forty percent had had chart-documented pneumococcal vaccination before the onset of bacteremia. The spectrum of clinical severity and consequences was broad. Ten percent were treated as outpatients. Of the 90{\%} who were hospitalized, 16{\%} were admitted to the intensive care unit. All-cause mortality at 30 days was 11{\%}. Of survivors, 23{\%} were discharged with home services, and another 20{\%} were discharged to a nursing home. After controlling for age, sex, and pneumococcal vaccination status, predictors of death included coronary artery disease (odds ratio (OR)=4.6, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.4-14.5) and immunocompromising conditions (OR=5.0, 95{\%} CI=1.6-15.7). Outcomes were similar in patients who did and did not receive pneumococcal vaccination. CONCLUSION: In this elderly group, pneumococcal bacteremia was associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and loss of independence. Coronary artery disease and immunocompromising conditions were independent predictors of death.},

IPD rates did not change for other age groups. In the Netherlands, PCV-7 offered high protection against vaccine-serotype IPD in vaccinated children, but increases of non-vaccine-serotype IPD reduced net vaccine benefits.},

abstract = {Objectives To explore how parents communicate their preferences for antibiotics to their child's physician and to examine whether physicians can communicate why antibiotics are not being prescribed in a way that maintains satisfaction with the visit. Design Previsit survey of parents, audiotaping of the study encounters, and a postvisit survey of parents and physicians. Setting Two private pediatric practices. Participants Ten physicians (response rate = 77{\%}) and a consecutive sample of 295 eligible parents (response rate = 86{\%}) who attended acute care visits for their children between October 1996 and March 1997. Main Outcome Measures Physician-perceived pressure to prescribe antibiotics and parental visit-specific satisfaction. Results Fifty percent of parents expressed a previsit expectation for antibiotics. Among these parents, only 1{\%} made a direct verbal request for them. Even when no direct requests for antibiotics were made, physicians still perceived an expectation for antibiotics 34{\%} of the time. Among parents who did not receive expected antibiotics, those offered a contingency plan from the physician (ie, the possibility of receiving antibiotics in the future if their child did not get better) had a higher mean satisfaction score than parents not receiving a contingency plan (76 vs 58.9;P{\textless}.05). Conclusion Physicians should consider providing a contingency plan to parents who expect antibiotics for their children when there is no clinical indication. Further study is needed to determine how parents indirectly communicate their desire for antibiotics and what additional communication techniques physicians can use to resist the overprescribing of antibiotics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in the incidence and serotype profile of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Australian children under 2 years of age after the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV). DESIGN AND SETTING: Analysis of incidence rates calculated using IPD surveillance data (including age, Indigenous status and serotype of the pneumococcal isolate) from 2002 to 2007 obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System and population estimates obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in IPD incidence among Indigenous and non-Indigenous children between 2002 and 2007; change in the serotype profile of IPD in non-Indigenous children after the introduction of universal 7vPCV vaccination in 2005. RESULTS: Overall incidence of IPD decreased by 74{\%} in all children {\textless} 2 years of age between 2002 and 2007 (P {\textless} 0.001). While the incidence of IPD caused by 7vPCV serotypes decreased significantly among both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children, the incidence of non-7vPCV serotype IPD increased significantly in non-Indigenous children (from 9.7 to 15.7 per 100 000, P {\textless} 0.001). Compared with a pre-vaccination period (2002-2004), the 2007 incidence of serotype 19A IPD in non-Indigenous children increased significantly (from 2.7 to 8.6 per 100 000, P {\textless} 0.001). In 2007, 19A was the predominant serotype causing IPD (37.7{\%}) in all children aged {\textless} 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of IPD decreased from 2002 to 2007, primarily driven by a reduction in IPD caused by 7vPCV serotypes. However, this was partially offset by a significant increase in the incidence of IPD caused by non-7vPCV serotypes, particularly 19A, in non-Indigenous children.},

The study was population-based, and prospective, and performed in primary health care settings. During a surveillance period of 12 months from 1981-1982, all pneumonia cases in a defined child population (57{\%} urban residents) were registered prospectively. In total, 201 CAP cases were diagnosed (mean age 5.6 years; 57{\%} boys; 58{\%} urban residents). S. pneumoniae etiology was studied by antibody and immune complex (IC) assays to C-polysacchride (C-PS), type-specific capsular polysaccharides (CPS), and to pneumolysin (Ply), in acute and convalescent sera. Serologic evidence of S. pneumoniae etiology was indicated in 57(28{\%}) cases, 35(61{\%}) being mixed infections with other microbes. The distribution of pneumococcal cases was 44{\%}, 30{\%} and 26{\%} in the three 5-year age groups, respectively. There were 33 (58{\%}) males and 34 (60{\%}) urban residents. In total, 26 cases were identified by antibody assays and 35 cases by IC assays, 26/35 being positive in acute sera. Responses to C-PS, CPS and Ply, when antibody and IC results are combined, were found equally often in 23-25 cases. The total annual incidence of pediatric S. pneumoniae CAP was 6.4/1000/year. S. pneumoniae etiology was found in 28{\%} of the children and was similar at all ages. The incidence of pneumococcal CAP was assessed for the first time, being high (19/1000/year) in 0- to 4-year-old urban boys and rather stable (5-9/1000/year) in all other groups by age, sex and residence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We evaluated the impact of the new pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10, GSK Vaccines) on tympanostomy tube placements (TTP). METHODS: Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal (FinIP) disease vaccine trial was a nationwide phase III/IV cluster-randomized, double-blind trial. Children {\textless}19 months received PHiD-CV10 in two thirds of clusters (N=52) or hepatitis B or A vaccine as control in 26 clusters according to 3+1 or 2+1 schedules (infants {\textless}7 months) or catch-up schedules. A secondary objective of the trial was to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against TTPs in children who received at least one vaccine dose before or after 7 months of age. Blinded follow-up lasted from the date of first vaccination (from February 2009 through October 2010) to December 31, 2011. Outcome data were collected through the National Care register and Social Insurance Institution reimbursement register. RESULTS: Over 47000 children were enrolled. In 30527 infants {\textless}7 months of age at enrolment, 4369 TTPs were reported in 3594 subjects. The incidence was 7.9 per 100 person-years in the infant control cohort. The VE estimate was 13{\%} (95{\%}CI -2 to 26{\%}) for combined PHiD-CV10 3+1 and 2+1 infant schedules. The VE estimates for the 3+1 and 2+1 infant schedules when estimated separately were similar. For the catch-up schedules, the VE was 11{\%} (95{\%}CI -7 to 26{\%}) for children enrolled at 7 to 11 months of age and -1{\%} (95{\%}CI -21 to 16{\%}) for children enrolled at 12 to 18 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that PHiD-CV10 immunization according to a 3+1 or 2+1 schedule initiated before 12 months of age may reduce the frequency of tympanostomy tube placements, although the primary analysis did not reach statistical significance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to compare the quality of antibiotic use among children in primary settings with the internationally developed disease-specific quality indicators and with National Guidelines. DESIGN Prescriptions of systemic antibiotics to the paediatric population ({\textless}18 years) at the primary level of healthcare for the period between 2011 and 2013 were analysed by using the National Health Insurance Fund's outpatient reimbursement database. RESULTS The mean annual number of antibiotic prescriptions was 1.887.615, while the mean annual number of children receiving antibiotics was 728.285. The prescription rate slightly decreased by 10{\%} from 1.516 antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 persons per year in 2011 to 1.365 in 2013. The highest percentage of prescribed antibiotics was observed in the group of children aged 2-23 months. The mean annual prevalence of antibiotic prescriptions was 54{\%}. The percentage of patients prescribed an antibiotic for acute upper respiratory tract infections, acute tonsillitis and acute otitis media (AOM) was above the proposed range (≤ 20), 87{\%} -96{\%}. These three diagnoses represent more than 69{\%} of all indications for prescribing antibiotics. The percentage of patients prescribed a recommended antibiotic was below the proposed range (≥ 80{\%}), 1{\%} -17{\%}, while the adherence rate to National Guidelines was low, 19{\%}-28{\%}. The percentage of patients prescribed quinolones was above the proposed range for AOM (≤ 5{\%}), 7{\%}. There were no significant differences in indicators value at the regional level in Serbia. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotic use among children in Serbia is extremely high compared with that in most other European countries. Major problems are frequent use of antibiotics for indications that usually receive no benefit from this treatment and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.},

One important question involves identification of the exact point in time when the observed phenomena begin to meaningfully change above and beyond baseline fluctuations. The authors introduce a nonparametric modeling framework to estimate the change-point of interest using derivatives of the underlying regression function for an outcome variable across time. The estimator of Huh and Carriere (HC) consistently performed acceptably when using a plug-in bandwidth in a Monte Carlo simulation study. It was shown that the estimator performed well with a minimum number of 15 design points. This procedure was applied to longitudinal data collected on performance anxiety. Results suggest that the HC estimator combined with plug-in bandwidth selection provides an efficient strategy for investigating a possible change-point at which an observed outcome variable starts changing across time.},

abstract = {Background: A seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the Norwegian childhood immunization programme in 2006, and since then the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has declined substantially. Recently, two new second generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have become available, and an update of the economic evidence is needed. The aim of this study was to estimate incremental costs, health effects and cost-effectiveness of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines PCV7, PCV13 and PHiD-CV in Norway. Methods: We used a Markov model to estimate costs and epidemiological burden of pneumococcal- and NTHi-related diseases (invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) and acute otitis media (AOM)) for a specific birth cohort. Using the most relevant evidence and assumptions for a Norwegian setting, we calculated incremental costs, health effects and cost-effectiveness for different vaccination strategies. In addition we performed sensitivity analyses for key parameters, tested key assumptions in scenario analyses and explored overall model uncertainty using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: The model predicts that both PCV13 and PHiD-CV provide more health gains at a lower cost than PCV7. Differences in health gains between the two second generation vaccines are small for invasive pneumococcal disease but larger for acute otitis media and myringotomy procedures. Consequently, PHiD-CV saves more disease treatment costs and indirect costs than PCV13. Conclusion: This study predicts that, compared to PVC13, PHiD-CV entails lower costs and greater benefits if the latter is measured in terms of quality adjusted life years. PVC13 entails more life years gained than PHiD-CV, but those come at a cost of NOK 3.1 million (∼€0.4 million) per life year. The results indicate that PHiD-CV is cost-effective compared to PCV13 in the Norwegian setting. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between introduction of paediatric ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery guidelines and population procedure rates. To determine changes in children's risk of undergoing ENT surgery. METHODS: Trend analysis of incidence of myringotomy, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy among New South Wales (NSW) children aged 0-14 between 1981 and mid 1999. Poisson regression models were used to estimate annual rates of change pre and postguidelines introduction and age/gender specific rates, and lifetable methods to determine risk of undergoing an ENT procedure by age 15. RESULTS: ENT surgery rates increased by 21{\%} over the study period. Children's risk of surgery increased from 17.9{\%} in 1981 to 20.2{\%} in 1998/99. Guideline introduction was associated with moderate short-term decreases in rates. For tonsillectomy, rates decreased between 1981 and 1983, but then rose continually until the introduction of myringotomy guidelines in 1993, when they fell, only to recommence rising until the end of the study period. For myringotomy, rates rose annually from 1981 to 1992/93 and fell in the 3 years following guideline introduction, after which they rose again. Increases were almost exclusively restricted to children aged 0-4 and correspond with increased use of formal childcare. The prevalence of myringotomy by the age of 5 years rose from 5.6{\%} of children born in 1988/89 to 6.4{\%} of those born in 1994/95, and the prevalence of tonsillectomy from 2.4{\%} to 2.7{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of young Australian children undergoing ENT surgery increased significantly over the last two decades despite the introduction of guidelines and no evidence of an increase in otitis media, one condition prompting surgery. Surgery increased most among the very young. We hypothesize this is related to increasing use of childcare.},

Topical treatment had better cure (NNTB???=???4.7, pooled RR???=???1.35, p???{\textless}???0.001) and microbiological eradication (NNTB???=???3.5, pooled RR???=???1.47, p???{\textless}???0.001 among 3 of the studies) than oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics had higher risk of diarrhea (pooled RR???=???21.5, 95{\%} CI 8.00???58.0, p???{\textless}???0.001, Number needed to harm (NNTH)???=???5.4) and dermatitis (pooled RR???=???3.14, 95{\%} CI 1.20???8.20, p???=???0.019, NNTH???=???32). The use of topical steroids in addition to topical antibiotics was associated with a higher cure rate (pooled RR???=???1.59, p???{\textless}???0.001 vs pooled RR???=???1.57, p???=???0.293). Conclusion Topical antibiotics should be the recommended treatment for management of tympanostomy tube otorrhea in view of its significantly improved clinical and microbiological efficacy with lower risk of systemic toxicity as compared to oral antibiotics. Further research is necessary to confirm the benefits of topical corticosteroids as an adjunct to topical antibiotics.},
