## Impact and cost-benefit analysis (Paper VI){#paper6}

Paper 6 is a cost-benefit analysis of PHiD-CV10 based on whole population observational data.
The study period is from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017.
The study population included all permanent Icelandic citizens.
Cost-benefit was estimated for three disease categories; invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia and otitis media, and was stratified by age-groups; 0-4 years of age, 5-19, 20-39, 40-64, 65-79 and 80+.
The data was analysed as a time-series and incorporated synthetic controls. 

Data were extracted from several registries.
The impact on otitis media was estimated among children 0-19 years of age.
Primary care visits with ICD-10 diagnoses compatible with otitis media (H65, H66, H70, H72) were extracted from the Primary Care Registry.
The observation period was restricted to 2005-2015, as the Primary Care Registry has not been updated for 2016 and 2017.
The impact on hospitalized pneumonia and IPD was estimated for all age-groups and for the whole study period. Hospitalizations with ICD-10 diagnoses compatible with pneumonia (J09-J18) were obtained from Landspitali University Hospital's patient registry.
Microbiological data were extracted from a database maintained by the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Landspitali University Hospital and linked to the patient registry.
A hospitalization was considered to be due to IPD if associated with culture or PCR confirmed *Streptococcus pneumoniae* sampled from joint fluid, bone, cerebrospinal fluid or blood, regardless of ICD-10 discharge diagnosis.
The aggregate number of visits and hospitalizations per calendar-month for diagnoses unrelated to *Streptococcus pneumoniae* infections were also extracted from both registries and used as synthetic controls (Table \@ref(tab:table-icd_synthetic)).

The cost-benefit analysis was completed in two seperate steps. 
First, the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction into the peadiatric vaccination program in Iceland was estimated.
This was accomplished using a previoulsy published Bayesian time-series methodology [@Bruhn2017; @Shioda2018a].
The pre-vaccine period was defined as January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, and the post-vaccine period as April 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. 
For each disease category and age-group, four models of PHiD-CV10 impact were estimated.
All were Bayesian Poisson models with observation specific random intercepts to account for over-dispersion [@R-pogit]. 
Each model utilized the pre-vaccine period to predict the monthly occurence of the outcome of interest in the post-vaccine period, had the vaccination not occured. 

The simplest model was a time-series without an offset term.
Calender-month effects were accounted for using dummy variables.
The time-series model used the pre-vaccine period to estimate the trend, and predicted the monthly number of cases of the disease category, assuming the pre-vaccine trend would have continued if the vaccination had not occured. 
A second, similar time-series model was also estimated, but included an offset of all non-respiratory visits.
This model used the pre-vaccine period to estimate the relationship between the outcome of interest and all non-respiratory vists, and predicted the occurence in the post-vaccine period assuming the relationship would not have changed, had the vaccination not occured. 
The third model included synthetic controls as covariates and used Bayesian variable selection to choose which of them to include [@Bruhn2017].
The prior for each synthetic control was set as a Dirac spike with a point-mass at zero. 
The pre-vaccine period was used estimate relationship between the synthetic controls and the outcome of interest, and select the optimal controls.
This relationship was used to predict the trend in the post-vaccine period had the vaccination not occured. 
Finally, a two-step model was fitted using a seasonal and trend decompisition (STL) and principal component analysis (PCA) [@Shioda2018a].
STL was used to extract a smoothed trend for each of the synthetic controls.
PCA was then used to extract the first principal component, and this was used as a covariate in the final prediction model.

Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to calibrate the models using data from the pre-vaccine period.
The LOOCV was also used to calculate the average pointwise likelihood for each model, diagnostic category and age-group. 
The average pointwise likelihoods were used as weights in a Baysian model stacking procedure, which produced the final stacked model used in the analysis.
