## Paper 5

Paper 5 is a single-centre, individual-level, observational cohort study of paediatric hospitalizations due diseases commonly caused by *Streptococcus pneumonae*. 
Eleven consecutive Icelandic birth-cohorts 2005-2015 were followed from birth until three years of age.
Immigration and emigration data obtained from Statistics Iceland was used to exclude children who had immigrated to Iceland after birth. 
Included were all hospital admissions to the Children’s Hospital Iceland from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2016.
The Children’s Hospital Iceland is the primary paediatric hospital for approximately 90% of the Icelandic population (www.statice.is) and serves as a secondary and tertiary paediatric hospital for the entire country.
Data on admissions were collected from Landspitali University Hospital's patient registry and microbiological data were extracted from a database maintained by the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Landspitali University Hospital.

Seven diagnostic groups were defined for the present paper.
Five groups represent diseases commonly caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae*; Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia and otitis media. 
The remaining two groups, upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and other lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) were included as comparators. 
A hospitalization was categorised as one of the paper’s diagnostic groups, if a relevant ICD-10 diagnostic code was recorded on the discharge chart, or if the admission was associated with microbiologically-confirmed IPD.
Admissions with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses compatible with meningitis (G00) were grouped as meningitis, (A40 and A41) were grouped as sepsis, (J09-J18) as pneumonia, (J20-J22) as LRTI, (H65, H66, H70 and H72) as OM and (J01-J06) as URTI (Table \@ref(tab:table-paper5-diagnostic-groups)).
A hospitalization was considered to be due to IPD, if associated with culture or PCR confirmed *Streptococcus pneumoniae* sampled from joint fluid, bone, cerebrospinal fluid or blood, regardless of ICD-10 discharge diagnosis.

Birth-cohorts were compared either individually, or grouped by vaccine eligibility. 
In the individual birth-cohort analysis, each birth-cohort was compared to the last vaccine non-eligible cohort, i.e. the 2010 birth-cohort. 
Birth-cohorts 2011–2015 were grouped as vaccine-eligible cohorts (VEC), and birth-cohorts 2005–2010 as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC).
Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. [@R-base] using the R packages; survival [@R-survival], RMS [@R-rms] and epiR [@R-epiR].

Mean age at hospitalization was calculated for each birth-cohort and diagnostic group.
Analysis of variance was used to test whether significant difference existed between cohorts, which was followed by Tukey's honest significant difference, procedure if an overall difference was identified.
Median hospital length of stay was calculated for each diagnostic group, and compared between between cohorts using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Crude incidence rates ($IR$) of hospital admissions were calculated for each birth-cohort, diagnostic group and age group, and incidence rate ratios ($IRR$) were calculated between the VNEC and VEC assuming Poisson variance.
The proportion of hospitalizations leading to admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) stay was calculated by birth-cohort and diagnostic group. 

The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was used to calculate both event-free survival as well as the event-free survival difference of the VNEC compared to the VEC for each of the diagnostic groups.
Subsequent hospitalizations of the same child with the same discharge diagnosis were excluded from this portion of the analysis.
Follow-up time was censored on emigration and death.
Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio of admission between the VNEC and VEC.
To elucidate whether potential differences between VNEC and VEC were likely to be due to direct effects of the vaccine, the Cox regression was repeated for two restricted age-ranges; 0-90 days of age and 90 days and older.
A sensitivity analysis with regards to potential unmeasured confounding of the hazard ratio was calculated using E-values.
An E-value represents the minimum association an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, to completely explain away the observed association.
