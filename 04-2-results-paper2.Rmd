The demographics of the study birth-cohorts are described in chapter \@ref(datasourcesresults) and Table \@ref(tab:table-cohort-results).
A total of 92,935 primary care visits for acute otitis media were recorded among birth-cohorts 2005-2015 during the study period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015.
The crude incidence rate of AOM visits to primary care per 100 person-years in the VNEC and VEC was 45.3 and 39.8 respectively. 
The IR and number of AOM visits by birth-cohort and gender are shown in Table \@ref(tab:table-paper2-incidence-results).

    x = hg_ag %>%

        group_by(birth_y, gender) %>%
        summarise(
            time = sum(time)/365.25,
            visits = sum(visit)) %>%
        mutate(
            incidence = format(signif(visits/time * 100, 3), nsmall = 1),
            ir_n = paste0(incidence, " (", format(visits, big.mark = ","), ")")) %>%

The lowest incidence was observed in children zero to three months of age, ranging from 3-6 visits per 100 person-years.
Thereafter, the incidence increased sharply, and peaked in children eight to eleven and twelve to fifteen months of age, ranging from 50 to 80 visits per 100 person-years. 
The crude IR decreased significantly in all age-groups, with incidence rate ratios ranging from 0.60 to 0.94.
The largest and visually most consistent decrease in incidence was observed among children zero to three months of age, IRR 0.6 (95%CI 0.51 to 0.69), Figure \@ref(fig:figure-results-paper2-incidence).

(ref:figure9) The incidence rate (IR) of acute otitis media (AOM) visits to primary care physicians is shown stratified by birth-cohort and four-month age-groups. The estimated IR is illustrated with a point and 95% confidence intervals are depicted with horizontal error-bars. The vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts (VNEC) are illustrated in red, and the vaccine eligible birth-cohorts in blue. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) between the VEC and VNEC is shown for each age-group and 95% confidence intervals are presented within parentheses.

When tabulated by the cumulative number of AOM episodes experienced by each child, the proportion of children experiencing zero episodes of AOM increased in the VEC compared to the VNEC, while the proportion experiencing one to four episodes and five or more decreased, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:table-paper2-proportion-results).

Discrimination indices for the Andersen-Gill multiple event model were adequate, Nagelkerke's $R^2$ = 0.110 and Somer's $D_{xy}$ = 0.238.
No systematic deviations in Schoenfeld residuals were detected on diagnostic plots indicating that the proportional hazard assumption for each covariate were met. 
There was little variation in the hazard of AOM between vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts. 
Only the 2007 birth-cohort differed significantly, with a hazard ratio of 1.06 (95%CI 1.01 to 1.12) compared to the 2010 birth-cohort. 
An abrupt and significant decrease in the hazard of AOM was noted in the first vaccine eligible cohort, which continued for all remaining VEC (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-results-paper2-hazard)).
The estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 on AOM episodes in the primary care setting among children younger than three years of age was 21% (95%CI 11% to 30%). 

(ref:figure10) The hazard ratio (HR) of acute otitis media (AOM) between each birth-cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort is shown. The estimated HR is presented with a point, and 95% confidence intervals are illustrated with horizontal error-bars. The 2010 birth-cohort is used as a reference and therefore no confidence intervals are presented. A dashed vertical line is placed on the ratio value of one to assist in visually estimating significance. The X-axis is on the logarithmic scale. The figure demonstrates an abrupt decrease in the hazard of AOM in the first vaccine eligible birth-cohort.

When the hazard ratio of AOM between VEC and VNEC was stratified by the number of previous AOM episodes, the vaccine impact was discernible in children who had experienced either no or only one previous AOM episode.
Among children who had more than one previous AOM episode, no effect was found (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-results-paper2-previous)).

(ref:figure11) The hazard ratio (HR) of acute otitis media (AOM) between the vaccine eligible (VEC) and vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC) is shown stratified by the number of previous AOM episodes. The estimated HR is illustrated as a solid black line, and 95% confidence intervals are presented as a shaded area. A dashed horizontal line is placed on the ratio value of one to assist in visually assessing significance. The Y-axis is truncated at a HR of 0.5 and is presented on the logarithmic scale. The figure demonstrates a significantly lower hazard of experiencing an additional episode of AOM among vaccine eligible children who have previously experienced zero or one episodes.

The mean number of AOM episodes in primary care was calculated as a function of age using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimate of the underlying Andersen-Gill model. 
By their third birthday, the average child in the VNEC had experienced 1.61 episodes of AOM. 
The average child in the VEC had experienced 1.37. 
The mean number of AOM episodes by age is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure-results-paper2-nelsonaalen).

(ref:figure12) The mean number of acute otitis media (AOM) episodes is shown as a function of age. The estimated mean is presented as a solid red line for the vaccine non-eligible cohorts and a blue line is used for the vaccine eligible cohorts. The 95% confidence intervals are illustrated as shaded areas. The figure demonstrates an early divergence in the mean number of episodes between the two cohorts.
