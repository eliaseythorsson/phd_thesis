<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Data collection and sources</h2>
<p>During the study period from Jaunary 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017, data were collected from multiple whole population registries, and from a single hospital registry. All data were identifiable to an individual level using national identification numbers, which are issued Each individual receives one and only one number over the course of their lifetime, and the identification number is permeanently retired at the time of death. The Directorate of Health processed all data from the various registries, linking them on the basis of national indentification numbers, and then anonymizing before releasing the linked data to the study group. Anonymization was accomplished by creating a study identification number during the linking process, which was generated directly from the national identification number in a reproducible fashion. The mapping key is kept by the Directorate of Health, and is not accessible to the study authors.</p>
<p>The data underlying this study are observational in nature, but their quality is enhanced by several factors. Not only are all medical records in Iceland stored electronically, but the same software, <em>Saga</em>, has been used by all health-care providers and instituitions throughout the study period. Likewise, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), is the only diagnostic coding system in use in Iceland during the study period. Furthermore, all medical procedures have been coded with the NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP), and dugs are classified using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) classification system of the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>In the following sub-chapters, each registry providing study data will be reviewed. Statistics Iceland provided data on immigration and emigration, demographic indices and salary. Clinical data was obtained from Landspitali University Hospital’s inpatient registry and the Primary Care Registry of the Directorate of Health. Pneumococcal vaccination status was collected from the National Vaccine Registry (NVR) and augmented with information on privately purchased vaccine doses obtained from the National Drug Prescription Registry (NDPR). Data regarding antimicrobial prescriptions were also extraced from the NDPR. Finally, reimbursement data for outpatient otolaryngological procedures were obtained from Icelandic Health Insurance.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Landspitali University Hospital inpatient registry</h3>
<p>Landspitali University Hospital is the sole tertiary hospital in Iceland, and encompasses Children’s Hospital Iceland – Iceland’s only paediatric hospital. It also functions as a primary and secondary hospital for the capital area, serving 65% of the Icelandic population. In 2017, the total number of hospital beds in Iceland was 1,050 <span class="citation">(Gobierno de España, Ministerio de Industria, and Instituto para la Diversificación y Ahorro de Energía IDAE <a href="#ref-OECD2017">2017</a>)</span>. Of those, 687 were at Landspitali University Hospital. The inpatient registry contains information on all emergency department and outpatient visits, and all hospital admissions to Landspitali University Hospital. For the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017, data were extracted on all unplanned acute-care visits and hospital admissions with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses compatible with respiratory infections (see Table <a href="methods.html#tab:table-icd">4.1</a>).</p>

<p>The data included the date of the visit, date of hospital discharge, hospital length of stay, the departments involved and a detailed breakdown of costs associated with the visit. A separate unique identification number was provided for each individual visit or hospital admission.</p>
<p>Several smaller data-sets pertaining to specific papers were extracted from the inpatient registry. These smaller data-sets were not linked to the main study data. For paper I, all doses of ceftriaxone administered at the Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 2009 and December 2015 were extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. Any ICD-10 diagnostic code associated with the visit or hospital admission in which ceftriaxone was administered, was extracted from the inpatient registry. Importantly, this included all ICD-10 codes, not only those in Table <a href="methods.html#tab:table-icd">4.1</a>. The aggregate number of yearly visits to the paediatric emergency department of Children’s Hospital Iceland 2008-2015 was also obtained for use in paper I. Paper VI required synthetic controls used within a time-series analysis framework. The aggregate monthly number of acute-care visits and hospital admissions for several sub-chapters of the ICD-10 diagnostic coding system (Table @ref(tab:table-icd_synthetic))) were obtained for 22 different age-groups.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> The Primary Care Registry</h3>
<p>In the Icelandic healthcare system, primary care is provided by family medicine physicians at 69 neighborhood based centers (<em>Heilsugæsla</em>). All primary care centers use the same electronic medical record system, and the same diagnostic coding systems (NCSP, ICD-10) as Landspitali University Hospital and Children’s Hospital Iceland. The Directorate of Health maintains a registry on all primary care visits within the Icelandic healthcare system. Due to extensive maintenance and restructuring ongoing since early 2016, no new data has been added to the registry since December 31, 2015. From this registry, all visits and phone-calls with ICD-10 diagnostic codes compatible with respiratory tract infections were extracted for the period January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2015 (Table <a href="methods.html#tab:table-icd">4.1</a>).</p>

It contains information on all filled drug prescriptions in Iceland. All pharmacies are required by law to collect data on each filled prescription and submit to the NDPR. An important distinction must be made between a filled prescription and a prescription. The NDPR receives information if and when a prescription is filled. It does not contain information on prescriptions that were never filled by the patient. All prescriptions contained within the NDPR were paid for and received by the patient. Extensive validation and error testing has been performed by the Directorate of Health to ensure the robustness of the NDPR. Automated electronic submissions, coupled with tightly controlled processes by which pharmacies dispense drugs, has essentially excluded the possiblity of any filled prescriptions escaping registration.</p>
<p>All prescriptions within the ATC therapeutic subgroup “J01” (Antibacterials for Systemic Use), “J07” (Vaccines), “S01” (Opthalmologicals) and “S02” (Otologicals) were extracted for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017. The chemical subgroups used in the study are shown in Table <a href="methods.html#tab:table-atc">4.4</a>)</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.6</span> Reimbursement database of Icelandic Health Insurance</h3>
<p>The healthcare system in Iceland is a single-payer system with one government-run health insurance provider, under which all permanent citizens are covered. Each healthcare visit requires a nominal out-of-pocket fee, with the rest of the visit covered by the insurance. Healthcare providers are either salaried governmental employees, or independent practitioners who are reimbursed on a per case basis, according to pre-determined negotiations with Icelandic Health Insurance. To receive pay for services, physicians must submit a reimbursement form detailing the nature of the visit and any procedures performed using pre-specified procedural codes. Icelandic Health Insurance maintains a reimbursement database which details the nature and number of procedures performed. Data on all otolaryngological procedures performed on the middle ear and tonsils were extracted from the reimbursement database for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017 using the procedural codes in Table <a href="methods.html#tab:table-reimbursement">4.5</a>)</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Paper 1</h2>
<p>The objective of Paper 1 was to evaluate whether the introduction of PHiD-CV10 was associated with a reduction in the incidence of otitis media with treatment failure. Treatment of otitis media with ceftriaxone was used as a proxy for treatment failure. Ceftriaxone use for other diagnoses and in older children was used as a comparator.</p>
<p>All children under eighteen years of age who visited Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015 were included. Children’s Hospital Iceland’s referral area was defined as a 100km driving distance from the hospital. Population demographic data for the referral area was obtained from Statistics Iceland (www.statice.is).</p>
<p>Data were extracted from Landspitali University Hospital’s inpatient registry. A visit was included in the study if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) was documented in the medical record, or if a child received one or more doses of ceftriaxone. All administered doses of ceftriaxone were systematically extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. The ICD-10 diagnoses associated with the ceftriaxone administrations were then obtained from the inpatient registry. The total number of visits per calendar year and month regardless of diagnosis was provided by the hospital.</p>
<p>Pre-vaccine (2008-2011) and post-vaccine (2012-2015) periods were defined based on the year of vaccine introduction. Because hospital visits for otitis media are uncommon in older children, the primary analysis was restricted to children under four years of age. Ceftriaxone use was analysed in three separate diagnostic groups; otitis media, pneumonia and other , based on the associated ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Ceftriaxone was considered to be due to otitis media, if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) were recorded, and due to pneumonia if ICD-10 codes Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) or Pneumonia, unspecified organism (J18) were recorded. Visits associated with ceftriaxone administration that did not fall into either of the above categories were classified together as “Other”.</p>
<p>The number of ceftriaxone treatment episodes per diagnostic group were aggregated by calendar month. An episode was considered distinct if no ceftriaxone administration was documented in the previous fourteen days. Incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-years were calculated by dividing the monthly number of ceftriaxone episodes per diagnostic group by the person-time of children in the referral area. The IR of OM visits were similarly defined and calculated. If a decrease were to be observed in the number of ceftriaxone treated OM episodes, it could be due to either a decrease in the number of OM visits or a decrease in the use of ceftriaxone. To evaluate this, the incidence risk of ceftriaxone treatment per 1,000 OM visits was calculated for the pre- and post-vaccine periods.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.4.4. <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R-base">2018</a>)</span> using the epiR package <span class="citation">(Stevenson et al. <a href="#ref-R-epiR">2017</a>)</span>. Incidence rate ratios (<span class="math inline">\(IRR\)</span>) were calculated between the pre- and post-vaccine periods and were estimated independently for each age-strata. The stratum-specific estimates were combined (when appropriate) using the Mantel-Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals calculated using the delta procedure <span class="citation">(Kirkwood and Sterne <a href="#ref-Kirkwood2003">2003</a>)</span>. The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the incidence rate ratio (<span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH}\)</span>) is the weighted mean of the <span class="math inline">\(IRR\)</span> in each stratum. The null-hypothesis that <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH} = 1\)</span> was tested by calculating the Mantel-Haenszel <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test statistic, from which the <em>P</em>-value was derived.</p>
<p>Combining sratum-specific estimates is appropriate when the exposure-outcome association is the same in each of the strata, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{age} = IRR_{MH}\)</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test of heterogeneity tests whether the data is congruent with the null hypothesis of no effect modification of the exposure-outcome relationship by strata. The greater the differences is between <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{age}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH}\)</span>, the larger the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> statistic. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH}\)</span> is not calculated and only the stratum-specific <span class="math inline">\(IRR\)</span> are presented.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Paper 2</h2>
<p>Paper 2 is a whole-population observational cohort study that followed all children born in Iceland between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2015, from birth until three years of age, death or end of the study period. All primary care visits in which an ICD-10 diagnostic code of suppurative otitis media (H66) was recorded were included. Any visits occuring within 30 days of a previously documented visit by the same child were excluded from the main analysis.</p>
<p>Data were obtained from the Primary Care Registry of the Icelandic Directorate of Health, and included all ICD-10 codes associated with the visit, as well as the date of the visit, age and gender of the child, and physician identification number. The study identification number used to identify unique individuals is directly derived from the national indentification numbers issued to each individual by the government. Individuals who had immigrated to Iceland after birth were excluded. Demographic population data was obtained from Statistics Iceland.</p>
<p>Cohorts were defined based on year of birth, or vaccine eligibility. Birth-cohorts 2005–2010 were grouped as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC) and birth-cohorts 2011–2015 as vaccine eligible cohorts (VEC). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R-base">2018</a>)</span> using the R packages; survival <span class="citation">(Therneau <a href="#ref-R-survival">2017</a>)</span>, RMS <span class="citation">(Harrell, Jr. <a href="#ref-R-rms">2018</a>)</span> and epiR <span class="citation">(Stevenson et al. <a href="#ref-R-epiR">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Crude incidence rates (<span class="math inline">\(IR\)</span>) were calculated per 100 person-years at risk for each birth cohort, stratified by four-month age brackets. The individual time at-risk was carefully constructed to exclude the 30 days following each recorded otitis media visit. This avoided including the period in which it was impossible for a visit to be recorded due to the study design. Crude incidence rate ratios (<span class="math inline">\(IRR\)</span>) between VNEC and VEC were calculated and confidence intervals estimated assuming Poisson variance.</p>
<p>In the subset of children who had full follow-up time, the number of children who experienced <span class="math inline">\(k = \{0, 1,...,12\}\)</span> episodes of otitis media were tabulated and the distribution between VNEC and VEC compared using the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test of homogeneity, Additionally, the crude risk ratio between the VEC and VNEC of experiencing 0, 1–4, or &gt;5 episodes of otitis media before three years of age was calculated.</p>
<p>The Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox regression model for repeated events was used to model data on the individual level and to account for censoring of follow-up time <span class="citation">(Andersen and Gill <a href="#ref-Andersen1982">1982</a>)</span>. To correct for successive visits by the same individual, Lin and Wei’s sandwich variance estimates were used <span class="citation">(Lin and Wei <a href="#ref-Lin1989">1989</a>)</span>. From this model, the hazard ratio (HR) of otitis media visits between each birth-cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort was caclulated. The impact of PHiD-CV10 on otitis media visits was calculated using 1 – (HR between the last vaccine-eligible birth cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort).</p>
<p>The HR between VNEC and VEC was calculated for each number of previous otitis media visits, and the mean number of episodes as a function of age was estimated from the model using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimator <span class="citation">(Cook and Lawless <a href="#ref-Cook2007">2007</a>)</span>. To determine the number of otitis media episodes prevented in the first five years of the vaccination, each child’s follow-up time was multiplied by the Nelson-Aelen estimate of the mean number of episodes. The absolute reduction in the incidence rate was then calculated by dividing the estimated number of prevented episodes with the total person-time of the VEC.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Paper 3</h2>
<p>Paper 3 is a whole population observational cohort study of antimicrobial prescriptions among children under three years of age in Iceland. Eleven consecutive Icelandic birth-cohorts 2005–2015 were followed from birth until three years of age. Children who imigrated to Iceland after birth were excluded. Follow-up time was censored on death, emigration, or end of the study period (December 31, 2016). Due to short follow-up time, the 2016 birth-cohort was not included in the analysis.</p>
<p>Data regarding outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions was obtained from the National Drug Prescription Registry, which has been previously described (Table <a href="methods.html#tab:table-atc">4.4</a>). Data on primary care visits for respiratory tract infections was collected from the Primary Care Registry using the ICD-10 codes shown in Table <a href="methods.html#tab:table-icd">4.1</a>. If a prescription was filled within three days of a documented physician visit by the same child, then the prescription and the visit were linked. Because data from the Primary Care Registry was only available through December 31, 2015, the portion of the analysis partaining to the linked data was restricted to that date. Population demographical data was acquired from Statistics Iceland (<a href="https://www.statice.is/" class="uri">https://www.statice.is/</a>).</p>
<p>The data was analysed descriptively over calendar-time, and from a cohort perspective. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R-base">2018</a>)</span> using the R packages survival <span class="citation">(Therneau <a href="#ref-R-survival">2017</a>)</span>, RMS <span class="citation">(Harrell, Jr. <a href="#ref-R-rms">2018</a>)</span> and epiR <span class="citation">(Stevenson et al. <a href="#ref-R-epiR">2017</a>)</span>. The descriptive analysis included all children under three years of age in Iceland. Based on a previously published study, all filled antimicrobial prescriptions was classified into one of six categories; first and second line penicillins, first and second generation macrolides, cephalosporins, and others <span class="citation">(Youngster et al. <a href="#ref-Youngster2017">2017</a>)</span>. The proportion of prescriptions within each category was calculated by calendar-year. Five diagnostic-groups were defined based on primary care ICD-10 diagnoses, and the proportion of cases resulting in an antimicrobial prescription was calculated per calendar-year. The groups were Acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), Other acute lower respiratory infections (J20-J22), AOM (H65, H66 and H72) and Other viral infections (B34).</p>
<p>Birth-cohorts were compared individually or grouped by vaccine eligibility. In the individual birth-cohort analysis, each birth-cohort was compared to the 2010 cohort – the last vaccine non-eligible cohort. Birth-cohorts 2011–2015 were grouped as vaccine-eligible cohorts (VEC), and birth-cohorts 2005–2010 as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC). The incidence rate (<span class="math inline">\(IR\)</span>) of antimicrobial prescriptions per 100 person-years was calculated in six-month age-brackets for each birth-cohort and 95% confidence intervals estimated using the Wald method <span class="citation">(Kirkwood and Sterne <a href="#ref-Kirkwood2003">2003</a>)</span>. Incidence rate ratios (<span class="math inline">\(IRR\)</span>) between the VNEC and the VEC were estimated and 95% confidence intervals calculated assuming Poisson variance. The cumulative proportion of children who had filled at least one antimicrobial prescription by three years of age was calculated and compared between the VEC and VNEC using the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test of homogeneity. The cumulative number of prescriptions by three years of age per child was categorized as &lt;1, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14 and ≥ 15 prescriptions, and the ratio between VNEC and VEC was calculated for each category. The 2014 and 2015-cohorts were excluded from the cumulative analyses, as they did not have the full three-year follow-up time.</p>
<p>The Andersen-Gill time-to-event model was fitted to the individual level data <span class="citation">(Andersen and Gill <a href="#ref-Andersen1982">1982</a>)</span>. It was used to estimate the hazard ratio (<span class="math inline">\(HR\)</span>) of antimicrobial prescription between the study birth-cohorts, which were included in the model as a categorical variable. The effect of age was accounted for by setting age as the model’s underlying measurement of time and stratification by gender allowed for independent baseline hazards. The number of previous antimicrobial prescriptions was included in the model and its relationship allowed to be non-linear by means of restricted cubic splines. <span class="citation">Lin and Wei (<a href="#ref-Lin1989">1989</a>)</span> robust sandwich variance estimates were included to account for successive prescriptions filled by the same child.</p>
<p>The impact of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions was estimated as 1 – (the hazard ratio between the last vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible cohorts) × 100%. The impact on each successive prescription was also estimated. Finally, the mean number of antimicrobial prescriptions for each gender and vaccine-cohort was calculated as a function of age using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimate. This was used to estimate the absolute number of prevented antimicrobial prescriptions during the first seven years of the intervention by adding together the expected number of prescriptions per child using the VNEC estimate of the mean and subtracting the expected number of prescriptions per child using the VEC estimate of the mean. The absolute rate reduction was calculated by dividing this estimate with the number of person-years at-risk in the VEC. A sub-analysis was performed to estimate the vaccine impact against AOM-associated antimicrobial prescriptions. The same regression methodology was applied to a subset of the prescriptions which were linked to a primary care physician visit with a diagnosis of AOM. Vaccine impact was similarly estimated as 1 – (the hazard ratio between the last vaccine eligible cohort and the reference cohort) × 100%</p>
