<p>Data was collected from multiple whole population registries and a single hospital registry. The study period was from January 1, 2005 until December 31, 2017. All data was identifiable down to the individual level based on national identification numbers, which are issued to every Icelandic resident at birth or when granted residency. A national identification number is not reused upon the death, and each individual receives one and only one number over the course of their lifetime. Data was sent from the various registries to the Directorate of Health for processing, where it was linked using national identification numbers, before being anonymized and subsequently released to the study group. Anonymization was accomplished by creating a study identification number during the linking process, which is generated directly from the national identification number in a reproducible fashion. The mapping key is kept by the Directorate of Health, and not accessible by the study authors.</p>
<p>The data underlying this study is observational in nature, but benefits from several factors. Electronic medical records have been ubiquitous in Iceland during the study period. The same electronic medical record software, Saga, has been used by all health-care providers and institutions throughout the study period. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), is the only diagnostic coding system which has been in use during the whole study period. All medical procedures have been coded with the NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP). Drugs are classified using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) classification system of the World Health Organization. In the following sub-chapters, each registry providing study data will be reviewed.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Landspitali University Hospital inpatient registry</h3>
<p>Landspitali University Hospital is the only tertiary hospital in Iceland, and encompasses Children’s Hospital Iceland – the only paediatric hospital in Iceland.<br />
It also functions as a primary and secondary hospital for the capital area, serving 65% of the Icelandic population. In 2017, the total number of hospital beds in Iceland was 1,050 <span class="citation">(Gobierno de España, Ministerio de Industria, and Instituto para la Diversificación y Ahorro de Energía IDAE <a href="#ref-OECD2017">2017</a>)</span>. Of those, 687 were at Landspitali University Hospital. The inpatient registry contains information on all emergency department and outpatient visits, and all hospital admissions to Landspitali University Hospital. For the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017, data were extracted on all unplanned acute-care visits and hospital admissions with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses compatible with respiratory infections (see Table @ref(tab:table_icd)).</p>

<p>The data included the date of the visit, date of hospital discharge, hospital length of stay, the departments involved and a detailed breakdown of costs associated with the visit. A separate unique identification number was provided for each individual visit or hospital admission.</p>
<p>Several smaller data-sets were extracted from the inpatient registry for specific papers. These smaller data-sets were delivered directly to the study authors and were not linked to the main study data. For paper I, all doses of ceftriaxone administered at the Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 2009 and December 2015 were extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. Any ICD-10 diagnostic code associated with the visit or hospital admission in which ceftriaxone was administered, was extracted from the inpatient registry. Importantly, this included all ICD-10 codes, not only those in Table @ref(tab:table_icd). The aggregate number of yearly visits to the the pediatric emergency department of Children’s Hospital Iceland 2008-2015 was also obtained for use in paper I. Paper VI required synthetic controls used within a time-series analysis framework. The aggregate monthly number acute-care visits and hospital admissions for several sub-chapters of the ICD-10 diagnostic coding system (Table @ref(tab:table_icd_synthetic))) were obtained for 22 different age-groups.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> The national drug prescription registry</h3>
<p>The national drug prescription registry (NDPR) is a whole population registry collected and maintained by the Icelandic Directorate of Health from January 1, 2005. It contains information on all filled drug prescriptions in Iceland. All pharmacies are required by law to collect data on each filled prescription and submit to the NDPR. An important distinction must be made between a filled prescription and a prescription. The NDPR receives information if and when a prescription is filled. This means that the NDPR does not contain information on prescriptions that were never filled by the patient. This also means that all prescriptions contained within the NDPR were paid for and received by the patient. Extensive validation and error testing has been performed by the Directorate of Health to ensure the robustness and coverage of the NDPR. The submission to the NDPR has been automated electronically and coupled with the process by which drugs are dispensed at the pharmacies, essentially excluding the possibility of a filled prescription not being registered.</p>
<p>All prescriptions within the ATC therapeutic subgroup “J01” (Antibacterials for systemic use), “J07” (Vaccines), “S01” (Opthalmologicals) and “S02” (Otologicals) were extracted for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017. The chemical subgroups used in the study are shown in Table @ref(tab:table_atc))</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> The Primary Care Registry</h3>
<p>In the Icelandic healthcare system, primary care is provided by family medicine physicians at neighborhood based centers (<em>Heilsugæsla</em>). Primary care centers use the same electronic medical record system, and the same diagnostic coding systems (NCSP, ICD-10) as Landspitali University Hospital and Children’s Hospital Iceland. The Directorate of Health maintains a registry on all primary care visits within the Icelandic healthcare system. Extensive maintenance and restructuring has been ongoing since early 2016, with no new data added to the registry since December 31, 2015. From this registry, all visits and phone-calls with ICD-10 diagnostic codes compatible with respiratory tract infections were extracted for the period January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2015 (Table @ref(tab:table_icd)).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> The National Vaccine Registry</h3>
<p>The Icelandic Directorate of Health maintains the National Vaccine Registry (NVR). All vaccine doses administered within the healthcare system are systematically recorded in the electronic health record at the time of administration. This record is reviewed and updated regularly, and vaccinations received elsewhere included. The NVR collects this information from all electronic health records in the country. All administered vaccine doses with ATC codes “J07AL” (Pneumococcal vaccines) were extracted for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> Reimburcement database of the Icelandic Health Insurance</h3>
<p>The Icelandic healthcare system is a single-payer system with a single government run healthcare insurance. All permanent citizens are covered. Each healthcare visit is associated with a nominal out-of-pocket fee, with the rest of the visit covered by the insurance. Healthcare providers are either salaried governmental employees or independent practitioners who are reimbursed on a per case basis, according to pre-determined negotiations with Icelandic Health Insurance. To receive pay for services, physicians must submit a reimbursement form detailing the nature of the visit and any procedures performed using pre-specified procedural codes. Icelandic Health Insurance maintains a reimbursement database which details the nature and number of procedures performed. All otolaryngological procedures performed on the middle ear and tonsils were extracted from the reimbursement database for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017 using the procedural codes in Table @ref(tab:table_reimbursement))</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Paper 1</h2>
<p>The aim was to evaluate whether the introduction of PHiD-CV10 was associated with a reduction in the incidence of otitis media with treatment failure. Treatment of otitis media with ceftriaxone was used as proxy for treatment failure. Ceftriaxone use for other diagnosis and in older children were used as comparators.</p>
<p>All children under eighteen years of age who visited Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015 were included. Data were extracted from Landspitali University Hospital’s inpatient registry. A visit was included if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) was recorded in the medical record, or if a child received one or more doses of ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone use was systematically extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. All associated ICD-10 diagnoses were then obtained from the inpatient registry. The total number of visits per calendar year regardless of diagnosis was provided by the hospital. Children’s Hospital Iceland’s referral area was defined as a 100km driving distance from the hospital. Population demographic data for the referral area was obtained from Statistics Iceland (www.statice.is).</p>
<p>Pre-vaccine (2008-2011) and post-vaccine (2012-2015) periods were defined based on the year of vaccine introduction. Because hospital visits for otitis media are uncommon in older children, the primary analysis was restricted to children under four years of age. Ceftriaxone use was analysed in three separate diagnostic groups<br />
A visit was considered to be due to otitis media if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) was recorded. Pneumonia visits were defined based on ICD-10 codes Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) or Pneumonia, unspecified organism (J18). Finally, visits associated with ceftriaxone administration that did not fall into either of the above categories were classified together.</p>
<p>The number of ceftriaxone treatment episodes per diagnostic group were aggregated by calendar month. An episode was considered distinct if no ceftriaxone administration was documented in the previous fourteen days. Incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-years were calculated by dividing the monthly number of ceftriaxone episodes per diagnostic group by the person-time of children in the referral area.</p>
<p>The IR of OM visits were similarly defined and calculated. If a decrease were to be observed in the number of ceftriaxone treated OM episodes, it could be due to a decrease in the number of OM visits or a decrease in the use of ceftriaxone. To evaluate this, the incidence risk of ceftriaxone treatment per 1,000 OM visits was calculated for the pre- and post-vaccine periods.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.4.4. <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R-base">2018</a>)</span> using the epiR package <span class="citation">(Stevenson et al. <a href="#ref-R-epiR">2017</a>)</span>. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) between the pre- and post-vaccine periods were calculated using the formula</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
IRR =
\frac{IR_{post-vaccine}}{IR_{pre-vaccine}} =
\frac{d_{post}/T_{post}}{d_{pre}/T_{pre}}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d_{pre}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_{post}\)</span> are the number of visits or ceftriaxone treatment episodes in the pre- and post-vaccine periods respectively, and <span class="math inline">\(T_{pre}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{post}\)</span> are the number of person-years.</p>
<p>The IRR was estimated independently for each age-strata and the stratum-specific estimates were combined (when appropriate) using the Mantel-Haenszel method <span class="citation">(Kirkwood and Sterne <a href="#ref-Kirkwood2003">2003</a>)</span>. The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the IRR is the weighted mean of the IRR in each stratum. The weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> for each stratum <span class="math inline">\(age\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
w_{age} = \frac{d_{(pre,\ age})\ *\ T_{(post,\ age)}}{T_{(pre,\ age)}\ +\ T_{(post,\ age)}}
\]</span> and the resulting Mantel-Haenszel adjusted IRR is therefore</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
IRR_{MH} = 
\frac{\sum(w_{age}\ *\ IRR_{age})}{\sum w_{age}} = 
\frac{\sum \frac{d_{(post,\ age)}\ *\ T_{(pre,\ age)}}{T_{(pre,\ age)}\ +\ T_{(post,\ age)}}}
{\sum \frac{d_{(pre,\ age)}\ *\ T_{(post,\ age)}}{T_{(pre,\ age)}\ +\ T_{(post,\ age)}}} =
\frac{Q}{R}
\]</span> The 95% confidence interval is derived using the delta method, and has range</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[IRR_{MH}\ *\ \frac{1}{EF}\ ;\ IRR_{MH}\ *\ EF]
\]</span> where the error factor is <span class="math inline">\(EF = \exp(1.96\ *\ s.e. \ln IRR_{MH})\)</span> and the standard error of the natural logarithm of the <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH}\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
s.e. \ln IRR_{MH} = 
\sqrt{\frac{\sum V_{age}}{Q*R}}
\]</span></p>
<p>in which the variance <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of strata <span class="math inline">\(age\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
V_{age} = 
\frac{(d_{pre,\ age}\ + d_{post,\ age})\ *\ T_{pre,\ age}\ *\ T_{post,\ age}}
{(T_{pre,\ age}\ +\ T_{post,\ age})^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, the null hypthesis that <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH} = 1\)</span> was tested by calculating the Mantel-Haenszel <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test statistic</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\chi^2_{MH} = 
\frac{(\sum d_{post,\ age} - \sum E_{post,\ age})^2}{\sum V_{age}};\ d.f.  =1
\]</span> from which the <em>P</em>-value was derived.</p>
<p>Combining sratum-specific estimates is appropriate when the exposure-outcome association is the same in each of the strata, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{age} = IRR_{MH}\)</span> If true, it follows that <span class="math display">\[
(d_{post,\ age} * T_{pre,\ age} - IRR_{MH} * d_{pre,\ age} * T_{post,\ age}) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test of heterogeneity is based on the weighted sum of squares of the above differences, and is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\chi^2 =
\sum \frac{d_{post,\ age} * T_{pre,\ age} - IRR_{MH} * d_{pre,\ age} * T_{post,\ age}}
{IRR_{MH}*V_{age}*(T_{pre,\ age}+T_{post,\ age})^2}
\ , d.f. = c-1
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the number of strata. It tests whether the data is congruent with the null hypothesis of no effect modification of the exposure-outcome relationship by strata. The greater the differences is between <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{age}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH}\)</span>, the larger the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> statistic. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the <span class="math inline">\(IRR_{MH}\)</span> is not calculated and only the stratum-specific IRR are presented.</p>
