I am writing the thesis in Rstudio using the bookdown package and hosting the thesis on Github. Writing the thesis in Rstudio confers many advantages. Tables and Figures can be created directly within Rstudio, which minimizes additional work associated with manually moving them into a separate writing program – a process both error-prone and labor intensive. All aspects of the writing, typesetting and data analysis are documented and version controlled. The bookdown packages automates the process of exporting the thesis to word, pdf and html formats. The thesis will be open access during the writing process. I believe I will be more motivated if my productiveness – or lack thereof, is held accountable to anyone who wishes to check. I would be grateful for any and all comments on any aspect of the thesis under construction. "],

It is also a common pathogen, and one of the most common bacterial causes of disease in humans. In classical medical texts, pneumococcus is described as a Gram-positive lancet-shaped coccus, usually found in pairs. In fact, pneumococcus is the Gram-positive coccus, being the first bacteria noted by Christian Gram that retained the dark aniline-gentian violet stain that now bears his name (Gram 1884). Pneumococcus was first isolated in 1881 by two microbiologist, George M. Sternberg in the United States and Louis Pasteur in France (Pasteur 1881; Sternberg 1882; D. A. Watson et al. 1993). The causal association between this newly discovered bacterium and pneumonia was firmly established only five years later (Weichselbaum 1886), and in the following decade, all clinical presentations of pneumococcal infection had been described (Robert Austrian 1981). The infectious manifestations of pneumococcal disease are, broadly speaking, local infections of the respiratory tract and infections of previously sterile tissue. They range from common to uncommon, and from benign to serious. The most common infectious manifestation of pneumococcus is otitis media (AOM) – an infection of the middle ear. The disease course is benign and rarely results in permanent disability. On the other hand, AOM is the most common reason for physician visit and for antimicrobial prescription in the paediatric population. Antimicrobial consumption is causally related to antimicrobial resistance, a major threat to public health. Recurrent or persistent otitis media is sometimes treated with the surgical placement of tympanic tubes, rendering it the most common surgical procedure in children. Thus, while AOM is a benign disease, it is associated with a large healthcare burden. A potentially more serious manifestation of penumococcal disease is pneumonia, the disease from which pneumococcus gets its name. Pneumonia often requires hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial treatment, and can lead to permanent disability and death. Pneumococcus can cause invasive infections if it gains access to normally sterile tissue. These includes bacteremia, an infection of the blood, and meningitis, an infection of the meninges. These infectious manifestations are grouped together as invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Whilst IPD is extremely uncommon, the consequences can be disastrous. The case-fatality ratio from pneumococcal meningitis in Iceland is estimated at 15.3%. Pneumococcal infections are responsible for a large healthcare burden that spans the range from outpatient to inpatient treatment. For over a century, scientists have attempted to prevent pneumococcal disease using vaccines with varying results. Pneumococcal vaccine development is complicated by the polysaccharide coating that protects pneumococcus from environmental factors. The polysaccharide capsule acts as an “invisibility cloak” to the human immune system, rendering it unable to detect pneumococcus except through certain patterns in the oligosaccharides contained within the capsule (Tuomanen, Austrian, and Masure 1995). Based on these patterns, pneumococcus has been classified into over 97 different serotypes to date. As the capsule contains only polysaccharides and not proteins, the immune response is T-cell independent and therefore poorly immunogenic, even after being identified by the immune system (Geno et al. 2015). The epidemiology of pneumococcus is dominated by person-to-person transmission of asymptomatic carriage. Because children have no previous immunity to any serotype, they are colonized by pneumococcus more frequently, and each colonization lasts longer (MELEGARO, GAY, and MEDLEY 2004). This phenomenon is further augmented when multiple immune-naive children congregate, such as in daycare centers and pre-schools (Yagupsky et al. 1998). Thus children act as a pneumococcal reservoir for the population, without actually having any clinical disease (Hoshino et al. 2002; Le Polain de Waroux et al. 2014; Mosser et al. 2014). Vaccinating children against certain serotypes may therefore lead to a decrease in pneumococcal disease caused by those serotypes in adults. In vaccine epidemiology, this is referred to as herd-effect and is an important consideration for pneumococcal vaccine development. Serotype replacement can also occur, where previously rare serotypes appear and fill the ecological niche vacated by the vaccine serotypes. Health systems operate under constraints on budgets and resources. Demonstrating vaccine benefit is essential, but not the only factor to consider when making health policy decisions. Cost and resource allocation are also of crucial importance. This is especially complicated in the case of vaccines, because benefits are not seen immediately but rather over time. Benefits occur in both vaccinated and unvaccinated members of the population. The diseases prevented by vaccines have associated expenses which must be accounted for when the expenditures for a vaccine program are evaluated. Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis are methods developed to measure the ratio between expenditure and benefit, and are used as a tool in making health policy decisions. To adequately perform such an analyses, detailed data on disease incidence and associated costs for the whole population must be available. Iceland is an independent island nation, isolated in the mid-Atlantic, with a homogeneous population of roughly 330,000 individuals. The first systematic program of vaccination against pneumococcus in Iceland began in April 2011, when the 10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influnzae protein-D conjugate vaccine (Synflorix, PHiD-CV10) was introduced into the national paediatric vaccination program. The vaccine program entailed two primary doses given at three and five months of age, and a booster dose at twelve months. No catch-up program was undertaken. Prior to the introduction, no systematic vaccination effort had been undertaken in Iceland. As the other Nordic countries, Iceland has a rich legacy of national health-related registers. Detailed individual-level information on vaccine status, outpatient primary care visits, antimicrobial consumption, tympanic tube procedures and hospitalizations are accessible, and linked between registries using national identification numbers. All healthcare costs are available on the individual-level from Icelandic Health Insurance, which is the insurer of all permanent Icelandic residents. This wealth of medical documentation enabled a unique whole-population ecological study examining the impact of systematic pneumococcal vaccination. 2.1 Clinical manifestations of Streptococcus pneumoniae In this chapter the clinical manifestations of pneumococcal disease will be reviewed. The mechanism by which individuals acquire pneumococcus into their normal upper respiratory flora will be discussed, and the association between pneumococcal carriage and disease will be described. Throughout this thesis, attention will be focused on three common clinical presentations of pneumococcal infections; AOM, pneumonia and IPD, including the pathophysiology, natural disease course, and health care burden of each of the presentations. Pneumococcus has gone by many names since it was first isolated in 1881. It was originally named Micrococcus pasteuri by Sternberg (Sternberg 1882), but by 1920, a scientific consensus was reached that the official name should be Diplococcus pneumoniae (Winslow et al. 1920). It was not until 1974 that pneumococcus received its current name, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Deibel and Seeley 1974). Because pneumococcus is both a commensal bacterium and a pathogen, its relationship with humans is complex. Most children are colonized by pneumococcus within the first months of life (Leino et al. 2001). The serotype distribution of the initial colonization in a child is influenced by the distribution of serotypes within the child’s family. Over the course of the their lifetime, a child will be colonized by many different serotypes. Their immune system will learn to recognize newly acquired serotypes and will either clear the colonization or maintain an equilibrium in which the serotype is kept within a certain limit of reproduction (Dowling, Sheehe, and Feldman 1971; MELEGARO, GAY, and MEDLEY 2004). In this manner, the contribution of pneumococcus to the human upper respiratory flora is in a state of constant flux. New serotypes enter while the old exit, and the relative density of serotypes changes. In some cases, the equilibrium between pneumococcus and the host is destabilized, triggering a rapid growth of pneumococcus and resulting in clinical manifestations. It is thought that this is most likely to occur directly following the acquisition of new serotype into the nasopharyngeal flora (Janet R Casey, Adlowitz, and Pichichero 2009). Because pneumococcus is carried in the nasopharynx, this overgrowth results in infections of adjacent tissue; the sinuses, middle ear and conjunctiva. The pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia is thought to occur through micro-aspiration of upper respiratory secretions, provoking a subsequent rapid proliferation of pneumococcus in the lower respiratory tract. Invasive disease occurs when pneumococcus penetrates the host’s immunological defenses and proliferates in normally sterile tissue. This can occur as a primary event, or can be secondary to infections of the upper or lower respiratory tract. Generally, IPD is considered to encompass meningitis, bacteraemia and septic arthritis. While some may argue that the middle ear is normally sterile, AOM is not considered invasive disease. 2.1.1 Acute otitis media Otitis media is an inflammatory state of the middle ear. It is most often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The clinical presentation of otitis media is variable. Its onset ranges from abrupt to gradual, and its duration from short to protracted. Several categories have been defined to facilitate communication concerning this variability. They are not mutually exclusive, but rather represent a continuum of the disease process. Otitis media can manifest as a acute inflammatory event. This is the classical AOM with which most parents are familiar. AOM can be recurrent, which is defined as AOM occurring three times over a six month period, or four or more times over a twelve month period. Conversely, it can take the form of a chronic low-grade process. The later phenotype includes otitis media with effusion and chronic suppurative otitis media. Otitis media with effusion is defined as the protracted collection of serous fluid in the middle ear. By convention, it is considered to be present if middle ear effusion has been documented to have lasted for three months or longer. It may follow AOM, or be detected without an obvious inciting event. Chronic suppurative otitis media may be thought of as a protracted case of AOM. The child remains sickly and the middle ear is filled with puss. The tympanic membrane often ruptures as a result. The anatomy of the middle ear is intrinsic to the epidemiology of otitis media, and can elucidate the wide range of presentations described above. The middle ear is located within a recess in the tympanic bone, medially to the tympanic membrane. It communicates with the nasopharynx by means of the Eustachian tube, a thin muscular canal that acts to equalize pressure between the middle ear and the external ear. This communication allows viruses and bacteria in the nasopharynx to gain access to the middle ear which clarifies the association between nasopharyngeal carriage and AOM. The Eustachian tube is anatomically shorter and straighter in children, partly accounting for the much higher risk of middle ear infections in children as compared to adults. It is also much thinner. Because of this, any cause of inflammation in the nasopharynx can lead to a spasm of a child’s Eustachian tube, resulting in the build up of secretions in the middle ear. These secretions provide optimal conditions for bacterial growth and can lead to subsequent otitis media. They can also remain macroscopically uninfected, which, if lasting long enough, would be categorized as otitis media with effusion. The anatomic view also helps to explain the mechanism of the contribution of different risk factors. The cycle of Eustachian tube dysfunction, effusion and increased risk of infection was the catalyst for the development of tympanic tube placements as a treatment for middle ear infections in children. By providing a secondary mechanism by which the middle ear could drain and equalize pressure, the rationale was that propensity for infection would decrease. 2.1.1.1 Pathogens implicated in acute otitis media Any pathogen that is able to gain access to the middle ear, disrupt the normal function of the Eustachian tube and replicate within the resulting fluid, has the potential to cause otitis media. In upwards of 90% of otitis media cases, the bacteria aspirated from the middle ear fluid will also be found in the nasopharynx (Janet R Casey, Adlowitz, and Pichichero 2009). The most common bacterial causes of otitis media are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis (Bluestone, Stephenson, and Martin 1992; Janet R. Casey and Pichichero 2004; Janet R Casey, Adlowitz, and Pichichero 2009; Ngo et al. 2016; Pumarola et al. 2013). The relative contribution of these three pathogens is remarkably stable between countries and over time. This is likely a consequence of how common they are in the nasopharyngeal flora of children. A systematic review of studies from 1970-2014 which reported the etiology of otitis media, found that Streptococcus pneumoniae caused 30.2% of AOM in Europe (Ngo et al. 2016). In countries that have introduced systematic pneumococcal vaccination, there is evidence to suggest that the microbiology of otitis media has shifted from being predominantly due to pneumococcus to Haemophilus influenzae (Block et al. 2004; Van Dyke et al. 2017). Of the pneumococcal AOM, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes has decreased and non-vaccine serotypes now predominate. Children with otitis media who experience spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane have a slightly different distribution of pathogens, with a higher proportion of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (Chen et al. 2013; Sonsuwan, Watcharinyanon, and Sawanyawisuth 2016). This could be explained by these pathogens causing a more aggressive infection, or possibly by contamination by bacteria located in the external ear canal. Similarly, coagulase negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus are more common in otitis media with effusion (Kim et al. 2013). Pneumococcal otitis media is slightly more likely to lead to recurrent otitis media and chronic suppurative otitis media, but is otherwise clinically indistinguishable from otitis media caused by other otopathogens. 2.1.1.2 Healthcare burden of otitis media The healthcare burden caused by otitis media is disproportionate to its severity. Acute otitis media is the most common reason for physician visit among children, a fact which has been frequently documented in multiple countries. Only focusing on physician visits underestimates the impact of AOM, as some episodes are not reported to physicians but still result in distressing symptoms in children and parental missed days of work. By a child’s third birthday, 60%-80% will have experienced at least one episode of AOM (Kaur, Morris, and Pichichero 2017; Teele, Klein, and Rosner 1989). Likewise, otitis media is also responsible for the majority of antimicrobial prescriptions, and thus contributes significantly to antimicrobial resistance. Though often benign and self-limiting, AOM can progress to recurrent or chronic infection and require more invasive treatment. Mastoiditis develops in XXX% of cases and will require hospital admission and administration of intravenous antimicrobials. Severe AOM can result in hearing loss and has been estimated to occur XXX%. 2.1.1.3 Tympanostomy tube procedures For various reasons, parents and clinicians may opt to treat recurrent or chronic otitis media with the placement of a tympanic tube. Tympanic tube procedures are consequently the most common surgical procedure in the paediatric population (N. Black 1984; Cullen, Hall, and Golosinskiy 2009). Despite their popularity, there is little evidence for the use of tympanostomy tubes for their two most common indications; recurrent otitis media and hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (Venekamp et al. 2018; Browning et al. 2010). Inconsistent evidence regarding the efficacy of tympanostomy tube procedures is mirrored in the large variation in incidence that is seen both within and between different countries. In Sweden, the incidence of procedures is low, and was in 1996, estimated to be 10 per 1000 person-years (Florentzson and Finizia 2012). The incidence was 5.6-6.7 procedures per 1000 person-years in Australia (Spilsbury et al. 2006). Even within the United States, there are large variations in the incidence. In 1988, the prevalence rate of tympanostomy tube placements among children younger than eighteen in the United States was estimated to be 13% (95%CI 11%-14%) (Bright et al. 1993). In Northern New England alone, the incidence varied between different paediatric surgical areas, from 3.79 to 13.15 procedures per 1000 person-years (Parker et al. 2016). The variation can possibly be explained by different thresholds for performing the procedure. By carefully examining the medical records of all children who underwent tympanic tube procedures in five hospitals in New York, Keyhani et al. were able to show that 92% of the procedures would not have been recommended according to the guidelines in force at the time of surgery (Keyhani et al. 2008). 2.1.1.4 Acute otitis media in Iceland The incidence AOM, its microbiology, treatment and complications have been evaluated in Iceland. In 1990, a retrospective analysis of two birth-cohorts in a small village in Iceland showed a 66% cumulative incidence of AOM by 24 months of age (Bjarnason, Friðriksson, and Benediktsson 1991). A larger study conducted in 1998 used parental questionnaires to estimate the incidence of upper respiratory infections that resulted in antimicrobial treatment and tympanic tube placements among children ages one to six years old (Vilhjalmur A Arason et al. 2002). A total of 1030 children were randomly sampled from four geographically separated areas of Iceland and the study achieved a 78% response rate. The study demonstrated high incidence rates of antimicrobially treated AOM for all age-groups, ranging from 1.79 treatment episodes among children one year of age to 0.25 treatment episodes in children six years of age. In this random sample, 58% of all antimicrobial prescriptions were due to AOM. The cumulative incidence of tympanic tube placements was alarmingly high. By one year of age, 23% (95%CI 16%-31%) had already received at least one tympanostomy tube. This proportion exceeded 30% by age two and remained fairly stable thereafter. The study was repeated by the same investigators in 2003 using the exact same cross-sectional random sampling (Vilhjalmur A. Arason et al. 2005). The proportion of all antimicrobial prescriptions that were due to AOM was almost exactly the same, 57%. Surprisingly, the cumulative incidence of tympanostomy tube placement had slightly increased and was now estimated to be 34%, 2.1.2 Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as the infectious infiltration of the lung parenchyma. Several different classification systems have been proposed to aid in the treatment of pneumonia (Mackenzie 2016). Some are based on the anatomical distribution of infectious infiltrates on radiographs, others on the symptomotology and still others on the distribution of risk factors in those being diagnosed with the disease. Each attempts to utilize readily available information to assist in selecting among treatment options and in predicting prognosis. While the ideal classification system would be based on the antimicrobial susceptibility of the causative pathogen, this information is rarely available when treatment decisions are being made. Most commonly, pneumonia is classified by assigning cases based upon the circumstances under which it was diagnosed. Pneumonia is classified as community acquired pneumonia if it is detected in people with limited contact with the healthcare system in the weeks prior to diagnosis. This is the most common type of pneumonia. Remaining pneumonia cases are classified as healthcare associated pneumonia, or hospital-acquired pneumonia if diagnosed during a hospital admission. This simple classification system is remarkably good at predicting antimicrobial resistance in the causative pathogen, and informs the choice of antimicrobial agents. The mechanism by which pathogens gain access to the lung and replicate there causing infection, is best understood by reviewing the pulmonary anatomy. The pulmonary system has an inverted tree configuration. The trachea acts as the trunk and subdivides into the main-stem bronchi, which lead to the right and left lung, respectively. The respiratory tree further subdivides into lobar and segmental bronchi, each of which supplies an independent anatomical segment of the lung, separated by connective tissue. Each compartment is known as a bronchopulmonary segment, and can be individually infected. Within each bronchopulmonary segment, these branches divide 18-20 more times, their diameter decreasing with every division. The final 16-22 divisions compromise the respiratory bronchioles which lead to the alveoli. To infect the lung, a pathogen must first arrive there. While this may seem like an easy task as gravity aids in the aspiration of upper respiratory secretions, it is, in fact, not a simple matter. As anyone who has experienced “food going down the wrong way” knows, the respiratory tree does not readily tolerate backward flow into the lungs. Irritation of the bronchi results in a cough, a powerful, coordinated neuromuscular response which propels any aspirated material up the respiratory tree. Pathogens are prevented from spreading downwards in a more insidious manner, by a constant flow of mucus from the the terminal bronchioles to the upper respiratory tract. The epithelial lining is covered with cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that relentlessly sweep the mucus upwards. Even when pathogens overcome this obstacle and progress down the respiratory tree, they are met with a heavy concentration of defensive immune tissue, the amount of which increases with every division of the respiratory tree. Risk factors of pneumonia are also best explained by referring to the defensive mechanisms employed by the respiratory tree. Processes which interfere with the cough reflex will result in a higher risk of pneumonia. These includes sensory deficiencies present in certain diseases and in the extremes of age, which result in the absence of cough initiation and muscular weakness. Pain associated with fractured ribs can also lead to voluntary suppression of the cough reflex and increases the risk of pneumonia. Another process increases the risk of pneumonia is damage to the respiratory cilia and the resulting stasis of mucus. Cilia damage can result from viral infection or from the inhalation of toxic particles, such as pollution or cigarette smoke, both of which can also cause local immune suppression, further compromising the lung’s defenses. 2.1.2.1 Pathogens causing pneumonia Any pathogen that is able to gain access to the lung and replicate there, has the potential to cause pneumonia. As is the case of otitis media, the most common bacterial pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influnzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (Rodrigues and Groves 2017). Here again, this is most likely to be a function of how common these pathogens are in the upper respiratory flora. Unlike otitis media however, it is exceedingly difficult to determine the causative pathogen in the case of pneumonia (Cilloniz et al. 2016; Feikin et al. 2017). Ideally, a sample would be taken from the lung itself, but the dangers of such procedures which moreover require highly trained personnel and technical resources, render this option unfeasible. Most studies, therefore, use proxy measures such as sputum, blood cultures and nasopharyngeal swabs. In addition, the inability of children to produce a quality sputum sample exacerbates the difficulties of elucidating the causative pathogen (Rodrigues and Groves 2017). The relative contribution of pathogens varies greatly with the age and risk factor profile. Only a few studies in developed countries have evaluated the distribution of pathogens which cause pneumonia in children, but they consistently demonstrate the importance of viruses in paediatric pneumonia. These results may either indicate that viruses are either the primary etiological factor, or that viruses weaken the respiratory defenses and allow bacterial disease to develop. The considerable heterogeneity in the proportion of pneumonias found to be caused by various pathogens, underscores the importance of study population, time-period and, most importantly, the methods used in determining the causative pathogen (Feikin et al. 2017). A large multicenter study, The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH), is underway to clarify the etiology of paediatric pneumonia (O. S. Levine et al. 2012). Its results have not yet been published. One of the first prospective studies of paediatric pneumonia was undertaken in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from 1963 to 1971. The study investigated all lower respiratory infections in children, and found most to be caused by respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Glezen and Denny 1973). The predominance of causative viruses is likely due to the methods, current at the time, used to detect etiology. Following the advent of pneumococcal antibody testing, the recognition of pneumococcus as an important pathogen increased. Using pneumococcal antigens, Paisley et al. found pneumococcus to be a contributor to 19% of paediatric pneumonias from 1978-1979 (PAISLEY et al. 1984). In a study conducted in Göteborg, Sweden from 1982-1983, a primitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine etiology, and found that 13% of paediatric pneumonias were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (CLAESSON et al. 1989). In that study, however, antibody testing for pneumococcus was only performed on those who were found to be pneumococcal carriers by nasopharyngeal swap. A few years later, in 1989, a prospective study of paediatric pneumonia in Turku, Finland demonstrated pneumococcus to be a causative pathogen in 38% of cases (Ruuskanen et al. 1992). Another etiological study in Paris in 1992-1994, enrolled 104 consecutive children who presented with pneumonia to a single hospital. Of those, 14% were found to have pneumococcal pneumonia (Gendrel et al. 1997). In populations where pneumococcal vaccination is universal, two studies on the etiology of paediatric pneumonia have been published. One of these, conducted in the United Kingdom in 2009-2011, found pneumococcus to be causative in 17.4% of cases (Elemraid et al. 2013). Another is a large prospective study of 2,358 children conducted in 2011-2012 in the United states, which utilized a variety of sampling methods, and detected pneumococcus in only 4% of cases, a result considerably different than all other etiological studies of paediatric pneumonia (Jain et al. 2015). The authors’ discussion of possible reasons for this included speculation that low proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia might be due to universal pneumococcal vaccination. All of the above studies identified respiratory syncytial virus to be the most common causative pathogen. Of the bacterial pneumonias, all but one found pneumococcus to be the most common. Their interpretation in complicated by the lack of direct sampling from the lungs. In studies that used strict radiological inclusion criteria and used lung aspiration to determine the etiology, pneumococcal pneumonia was by far the most common pathogen (Gilani et al. 2012; World Health Organization Pneumonia Vaccine Trial Investigators’ Group 2001). While the etiology of adult pneumonia has been more extensively studied, the same challenges are encountered as in the study of children. The estimated proportion of pneumonia cases caused by different pathogens varies between studies. This may represent a true difference in the underlying study populations or may be a result of different study design and methodology. A recent meta-analysis evaluated all published studies of pneumonia etiology in Europe from 1990-2011, and estimated the crude proportion caused by pneumococcus to be 19.3% (Rozenbaum et al. 2013). Seventy-seven studies were included, and inclusion criteria were strict, considering only radiologically confirmed pneumonia. The crude estimate of the proportion of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae was 19.3%. After adjusting for several variables using a fixed-effects meta-regression model, the estimated proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia in the average Northern European country was 15%. 2.1.2.2 Healthcare burden of pneumonia Lower respiratory infections were, in 2016, estimated to cause 2,38 million deaths worldwide and were the sixth leading cause of death (Troeger et al. 2018). Of those deaths, 652,572 (95%CI 586,475-720,612) were estimated to occur among children under five years of age, making lower respiratory infections the leading cause of death in this age-group. Large variations exist in the incidence, morbidity and mortality of pneumonia between countries. Pneumonia disproportionately affects developing countries, which experience over half of the pneumonia associated mortality. Yet pneumonia is still a large healthcare burden in developed countries, and accounts for 3%-18% of all childhood hospital admissions (S. a Madhi et al. 2012). In developed countries, the incidence of pneumonia in children under five years of age is 34-40 cases per 1000 person-years. 2.1.2.3 Pneumonia in Iceland Paragraph about Icelandic literature and changing epidemiology - Pneumococcal pneumonia prevalence and serotype distribution - Rate of hospitalization, healthcare consumption - Rate of sequelae 2.1.3 Invasive pneumococcal disease ~ 3 -5 pages - Define different presentations of IPD: meningitis, bacteremia, etc. - Epidemiology, both serotype and age - Risk factors - Burden of disease, health care utilization - Severity - Hospitalization rates, ICU rates - Sequelae - Review of Icelandic literature and changing epidemiology - Meningitis, bacteremia, empyema, joint infection prevalence and serotype distribution - Rate of sequelae 2.2 Pneumococcal vaccines In this chapter we will review the history of pneumococcal vaccination to better understand the current vaccine climate. Special attention will be paid to the scientific discourse that led to the recognition of the need for conjugating pneumococcal polysaccharides to a protein carrier. Several key concepts in pneumococcal vaccine epidemiology will be discussed, e.g. herd-effect and serotype-replacement. The scientific literature on the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on AOM, pneumonia and IPD will be reviewed and discussed. Special attention will be paid to issues of study design and statistical methodology and their effect on study interpretation. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies will be reviewed separately. Finally, the evidence will be summarized. 2.2.1 A brief history of pneumococcal vaccination The history of pneumococcal vaccination can be roughly divided into three phases; the inactivated (killed) whole-cell vaccines; the polysaccharide vaccines and the conjugated vaccines. It begins in 1911 when Wright and colleagues attempted to use an inoculation of heat-killed pneumococcus to vaccinate South African miners against pneumococcal pneumonia (Wright et al. 1914). It should be noted however, that in George Sternberg’s original description of pneumococcus in 1881, he observed that rabbits who were injected with saliva mixed with alcohol and quinine died less frequently than those injected with saliva alone, and were later resistant to re-injection with saliva (Robert Austrian 1999; Sternberg 1882). Sternberg had inadvertently immunized the laboratory animals against subsequent infection by injecting killed pneumococci, thus proving the concept 30 years before it was first attempted. The 1911 trial by Wright failed to demonstrate efficacy because the significance of serotypes and serotype specific immunogenicity was not known. In the following two decades, several trials using inactivated whole-cell pneumococcal vaccines were published (Cecil 1918; Lister 1916; Lister and Ordman 1936; Maynard 1913) Due to inconsistencies in study design, the efficacy of whole bacteria pneumococcal vaccines remained fiercely debated at the time, despite some evidence of benefit (Robert Austrian 1999). Following discoveries of the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide capsule in the 1920s and 1930 (Dochez and Avery 1917; Finland 1931; Francis and Tillett 1930; M. Heidelberger and Avery 1923; Schiemann and Casper 1927), inactivated whole-cell pneumococcal vaccines were soon replaced with polysaccharide vaccines. The first clinical trial of a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was conducted in the 1930s on 29,000 adult males in the American Civilian Conservation Corps using a bivalent vaccine (Ekwurzel et al. 1938). With similar methodological problems of previous trials of the inactivated vaccines, the results were debated. A second large trial was conducted in the late 1930s, using a tetravalent polysaccharide vaccine (Macleod et al. 1945). This trial built upon the experience of the previous trials, and was able to show convincing efficacy against pneumococcal pneumonia, leading to the licensure of two hexavalent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines in the 1940s. One was formulated for adults and the other for children, each optimized to the serotype distribution within the respective age-group. Unfortunately, these early vaccines fell victim to unfavorable timing; in 1944, Tillet and colleagues showed that bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia could be cured by parenteral administration of benzylpenicillin (Tillett, Cambier, and McCormack 1944). With this discovery, the medical community became complacent. The mortality rate of pneumococcal disease decreased sufficiently that there was no longer a perceived need for preventative vaccination. The licenses for the polysaccharide vaccines were withdrawn by the manufacturer due to lack of use (Robert Austrian 1999). Interest in pneumococcal vaccination re-emerged in the 1950s when it was noted that the mortality benefit of penicillin was not ubiquitous. The elderly and those who had underlying disease did not experience a decrease in their case fatality ratio (Robert Austrian and Gold 1964). This led to a redoubled effort to create a new polysaccharide vaccine. Several large randomized controlled trials were conducted in South Africa in the 1970s (R Austrian et al. 1976, Smit (1977)) and, on the basis of these, a 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1977. Its valency was increased to 23 polysaccharides in 1983 (Robert Austrian 1999). Early in the development of pneumococcal vaccines, there was an interested in vaccinating children. Two trials were conducted in the early 1980s which tested the use of polysaccharide vaccines in young children. Neither showed benefit (Mäkelä et al. 1981; Sloyer, Ploussard, and Howie 1981). This result was not entirely unexpected. In 1937, The first polysaccharide trial conducted in children failed to detect any immunological response (Davies 1937). Laboratory studies in the 1930s and 1940s revealed that the reason for this lack of efficacy was due to the thymus independent immune response to purely sacharide antigens. These same studies showed that this could be remedied by adding a protein adjuvant, thus inducing a T-cell response. The strategy of protein conjugation saw its first success in the development of the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. Subsequently, several different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines entered phase II and phase III clinical trials in the late 1990s (Robert Austrian 1999). The first of these to receive licensure was the seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, licensed in 2000 in the United States. It included the purified polysaccharides of seven serotypes of pneumococcus (4, 9V, 14, 19F, 23F, 18C and 6B) conjugated to CRM197 (PCV7CRM197), a nontoxic variant of the diphtheria toxin. It was shown to be efficacious for IPD, pneumococcal pneumonia and AOM in several randomized trials (S. Black et al. 2000; S. B. Black et al. 2002; Eskola et al. 2001; Fireman et al. 2003; K. L. O’Brien et al. 2003; O’Brien et al. 2008). In the 2000s, higher valency conjugated vaccines were developed and received licensure, based on the randomized trials conducted for the heptavalent conjugated vaccine. They have however been shown to be effective in several cluster randomized trials and observational studies. 2.2.2 Key concepts in pneumococcal vaccine epidemiology The epidemiology of pneumococcus is complicated by its relationship with humans. It is both a component of the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract and a common pathogen. Because of the polysaccharide coat, protection against one serotype does not necessarily confer protection against another. If one serotype disappears due to immune recognition, an ecological niche is created which can be filled by different serotype. This process takes place on both the individual and community level. Systematic vaccination programs greatly reduce the prevalence of carriage and disease of the serotypes contained within the vaccine among the vaccinated. If the vaccinated individuals compromise a large enough portion of the population. 2.2.3 The impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on otitis media Acute otitis media is still most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae despite changes in otopathogens. Prevention of IPD in children and the associated morbidity and mortality was the driving force in the development of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. However, the public most often associates them with AOM. Most children experience AOM and the dramatic decrease in incidence following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is what families noticed. Despite this, AOM is a difficult outcome for trialist as it exists on a continuum. It does not have universally adhered to diagnostic criteria and its signs and symptoms greatly overlap with those of other common diseases. Because AOM is benign and most often self-limited, the probability that a child with AOM is even seen by a physician varies greatly with parental health seeking behavior. Even when AOM is accurately diagnosed it is not possible to ascertain the causative pathogen without invasive sampling, which is not warranted given the benign nature of the disease. This precludes measuring the serotype specific effect of vaccination for most studies - and more importantly, it precludes measuring the effect on pneumococcal AOM. Thus any estimation of an effect of pneumococcal vaccination will necessarily by diluted by the subjectiveness of AOM diagnosis and the continued lack of protection against other otopathogens. Despite these difficulties, AOM has been associated with pneumococcal vaccination in children from the beginning. It was used as an outcome measure in the earliest trials of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (Mäkelä et al. 1981; Sloyer, Ploussard, and Howie 1981). In the following sub-chapters, the evidence regarding the efficacy and impact of PCV on the otitis media will be reviewed. Randomized controlled trials will be reviewed in greater depth, as they represented the highest quality of evidence of true efficacy. Observational studies will be reviewed more generally. 2.2.3.1 Randomized controlled trials The first published randomized controlled trial of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reported, among other outcomes, the efficacy against AOM (S. Black et al. 2000). The study recruited 37,868 children between October 1995 and August 1998 and randomized them to the either PCV7CRM197 or the meningococcus C CRM197 conjugate vaccine. A separate publication from the same trial was published in 2003, and examined the effect of PCV7CRM197 on AOM in more detail using the full data until study completion in April 1999 (Fireman et al. 2003). A visit was considered to be due to the same episode of AOM if the child presented within 21 days of a previous AOM associated visit. Frequent otitis media was then defined as either three episodes within a six month period, or four episodes within a twelve month period. Both the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox proportional hazards model with robust variance estimation and the binomial test with Klopper-Pearson confidence intervals were used and efficacy was reported as \\((1 - ratio\\ measure) *100\\%\\). The estimated vaccine efficacy against otitis media visits was 7.8% (95%CI 5.4%-10.2%). Slightly higher point estimates were found for otitis media episodes, frequent otitis media and ventilatory tube placements (S. Black et al. 2000; Fireman et al. 2003) The following year the results of two more randomized controlled trials were published (R. Dagan et al. 2001; Eskola et al. 2001). R. Dagan et al. (2001) enrolled 264 children ages 12-35 months of age attending eight daycare centers in Beer-Sheva, Isreal. The study employed a block randomized design which stratified the children according to daycare center and age-group. Within each stratified group, children were randomized in blocks of six. The study examined a nine valent pneumococcal CRM197 conjugate vaccine produced by Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and used the same meningococcal C CRM197 conjugate vaccine as the S. Black et al. (2000) study as a control. The study’s primary endpoint was vaccine-type nasopharyngeal carriage and the secondary endpoint was parent reported respiratory infections. Monthly questionnaires were submitted to parents for one year starting one month after the last per-protocol vaccine dose, and bimonthly thereafter for a total of 18 encounters. Respiratory infections were split into four different categories (Upper respiratory infections, lower respiratory problems, otitis media and other illnesses) and the results were measured in two different ways; episodes per 100 child-months and the proportion of antimicrobial days during the study period. Finally, each category and measurement was compared in children &lt;36 months of age, 36 months of age and older, and overall, resulting in \\(4\\ *\\ 2\\ *\\ 3=16\\) comparisons between the intervention and control. The statistical analysis used \\(\\chi^2\\) and Fischer’s exact contingency table methods but did not account for multiple testing. The study reported an efficacy of 17% (95%CI -2%-33%) for otitis media episodes and 20% (95%CI 14%-26%) antimicrobial treated otitis media, as measured by days spent on antimicrobial. The later does remain statistically significant when the result has been corrected for multiple testing using any standard method. The later study published in 2001 compared two heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines to a hepatitis B vaccine control (Eskola et al. 2001). The two heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines differed in their use of carrier protein. One was the same vaccine as in the S. Black et al. (2000) study (PCV7CRM197), and the other was a conjugated to meningococcal outer membrane protein complex (PCV7MOMPC). The Eskola et al. (2001) paper reported comparison of the PCV7CRM197 to the hepatitis B vaccine. The analogous comparison of the PCV7MOMPC was reported in a separate publication (T Kilpi et al. 2003). No head-to-head comparison of the two heptavalent vaccines was ever reported. The study methodology was identical between the two publications as they report different arms of the same study (Eskola et al. 2001; T Kilpi et al. 2003). The study was specifically designed to address the difficulties associated with estimating the effect of pneumococcal vaccination on AOM. A total of 2,497 children were enrolled between December 1995 and April 1997, of which 835 received the PCV7MOMPC vaccine and were therefore not reported in the Eskola et al. (2001) paper. Children were followed until their last visit at 24 months of age. Of the enrolled children, 95.1% completed full follow-up time and there was no evidence of differential dropout. The study defined beforehand the criteria for what constituted AOM and employed a trained study nurse and physician at each study site. Children were seen at enrollment at two months of age, and periodically assessed thereafter at four, six, seven, twelve, thirteen and 24 months of age. If AOM was diagnosed as defined by the study criteria, myringotomy and aspiration of middle-ear fluid were performed and samples sent for culture. In this way, the study was able to deduce the causative otopathogen. Episodes of AOM were classified as all-cause AOM; culture-confirmed and otopathogen specific AOM; and AOM due to serotypes included in the vaccine. The statistical analysis was again conducted using the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox proportional hazards model with robust variance estimates and efficacy was reported as \\((1 - hazard\\ ratio) *100\\%\\). The results were most consistent with a 6% efficacy against all-cause AOM with 95% confidence limits of -4% and 16%. In this case the negative lower confidence limit indicates the data could be consistent with the possibility of a 4% increase in all-cause AOM, given the specified model. The PCVCRM197 efficacy against culture-confirmed pneumococcal AOM was 35% (95%CI 21%-45%) and was 57% (95%CI 44%-67%) for the seven serotypes included in the vaccine. Similarly, the study demonstrated 57% (95%CI 27%-76%) efficacy against AOM caused by serotype 6A, which is considered a cross-reactive pneumococcal serotype. The study was also one of the first to demonstrate clinically relevant serotype replacement, showing a 33% (95%CI -1%-80%) increase in pneumococcal AOM caused by serotypes not included in the vaccine. Children who completed the Eskola et al. (2001) trial and were still living in the study area were invited for a follow-up interview when they were four to five years of age (A. A. I. Palmu et al. 2004). In the extended follow-up trial, the vaccine effectiveness against all tympanostomy tube placements was estimated to be 39% (95%CI 4%-61%). However, this was unblinded study following the unmasking of the original study and there was differential recruitment between the placebo and PCV7CRM197 arms. There was therefore a substantial risk of bias in the study. The effect estimates for the PCV7MOMPC against culture-confirmed pneumococcal AOM was 25% (95%CI 11%-37%) and was 56% (95%CI 44%-66%) for the seven serotypes included in the vaccine (T Kilpi et al. 2003). However, unlike PCVCRM197, it did not seem to confer protection against cross-reactive serotypes. Interestingly, virtually no effect was seen on all-cause AOM with this vaccine preparation. The effect estimate was -1% (95%CI -12%-10%). These surprising results were not presented in the main text and no explanation was given in the discussion chapter of the paper. In 2006, Prymula et al. (2006) reported a randomized study of an eleven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 4,968 children recruited from paediatric centers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (Prymula et al. 2006). A strict case definition of otitis media was used and all cases were reviewed by an otolaryngologist. If confirmed, a middle ear fluid sample was obtained by aspiration and sent for culturing. Statistical analysis was completed using Cox proportional hazards models and the Anderson-Gill extension for repeated events. In 2003, the first paper from a cluster randomized controlled trial of PCV7CRM197 among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache infants was published (K. L. O’Brien et al. 2003). In 2008, a retrospective chart review of AOM visits among the participating children was published (O’Brien et al. 2008). The study population was defined as children who had adhered to the study protocol, i.e. a per-protocol analysis. From this population, 944 of the 4,476 eligible children were randomly sampled for chart review. The sample size was restricted for logistical reasons. A rough power analysis which assumed 1.5 years of follow-up time per chart and a baseline incidence of one AOM visit per person-year suggested that a sample of 1,000 children would give 80% power to detect a 15% reduction in the incidence of AOM visits. It is unclear why only 944 children were sampled, given that the power calculation assumed 1,000. Furthermore, it should be noted that the investigators performing the chart review were not blinded to vaccine allocation. This becomes significant when considering that the reviewers had significant leeway in deciding what constituted an AOM visit, and how to categorize the multitude of subjective subgroups considered in the study. Of the 944 children reviewed, only 803 were included for various reasons further limiting the study’s sample. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio between the study arms, and sandwich variance estimates were used to account for the block-randomized design. No difference was found between the PCV7CRM197 arm and the control, with an estimated vaccine efficacy of -0.4% (95%CI -19.4%-15.6%). It is debatable whether this should be considered a randomized controlled trial in light of the methodological flaws discussed above. Even if the study were to be considered randomized, it is unclear how to interpret a study that does not even have 80% power to detect a difference twice as large as the the estimates presented by previous randomized controlled trials.

All data were identifiable to an individual level using national identification numbers, which are issued Each individual receives one and only one number over the course of their lifetime, and the identification number is permeanently retired at the time of death. The Directorate of Health processed all data from the various registries, linking them on the basis of national indentification numbers, and then anonymizing before releasing the linked data to the study group. Anonymization was accomplished by creating a study identification number during the linking process, which was generated directly from the national identification number in a reproducible fashion. The mapping key is kept by the Directorate of Health, and is not accessible to the study authors. The data underlying this study are observational in nature, but their quality is enhanced by several factors. Not only are all medical records in Iceland stored electronically, but the same software, Saga, has been used by all health-care providers and instituitions throughout the study period. Likewise, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), is the only diagnostic coding system in use in Iceland during the study period. Furthermore, all medical procedures have been coded with the NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP), and dugs are classified using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) classification system of the World Health Organization. In the following sub-chapters, each registry providing study data will be reviewed. Statistics Iceland provided data on immigration and emigration, demographic indices and salary. Clinical data was obtained from Landspitali University Hospital’s inpatient registry and the Primary Care Registry of the Directorate of Health. Pneumococcal vaccination status was collected from the National Vaccine Registry (NVR) and augmented with information on privately purchased vaccine doses obtained from the National Drug Prescription Registry (NDPR). Data regarding antimicrobial prescriptions were also extraced from the NDPR. Finally, reimbursement data for outpatient otolaryngological procedures were obtained from Icelandic Health Insurance. 4.1.1 Statistics Iceland Statistic Iceland collects and maintains a large array of economical, social and demographic indices and provides aggregate data freely at www.statice.com. 4.1.2 Landspitali University Hospital inpatient registry Landspitali University Hospital is the sole tertiary hospital in Iceland, and encompasses Children’s Hospital Iceland – Iceland’s only paediatric hospital. It also functions as a primary and secondary hospital for the capital area, serving 65% of the Icelandic population. In 2017, the total number of hospital beds in Iceland was 1,050 (Gobierno de España, Ministerio de Industria, and Instituto para la Diversificación y Ahorro de Energía IDAE 2017). Of those, 687 were at Landspitali University Hospital. The inpatient registry contains information on all emergency department and outpatient visits, and all hospital admissions to Landspitali University Hospital. For the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017, data were extracted on all unplanned acute-care visits and hospital admissions with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses compatible with respiratory infections (see Table 4.1). Table 4.1: The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes used in the current study ICD-10 code Disease A40 Streptococcal sepsis A41 Other sepsis A48 Other bacterial diseases, not elsewhere classified A49 Bacterial infection of unspecified site B00 Herpesviral [herpes simplex] infections B08 Other viral infections characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions, not elsewhere classified B33 Other viral diseases, not elsewhere classified B34 Viral infection of unspecified site B95 Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere B96 Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere G00 Bacterial meningitis,not elsewhere classified H65 Nonsuppurative otitis media H66 Suppurative and unspecified otitis media H70 Mastoiditis and related conditions H72 Perforation of tympanic membrane H73 Other disorders of tympanic membrane J00 Acute nasopharyngitis [common cold] J01 Acute sinusitis J02 Acute pharyngitis J03 Acute tonsillitis J04 Acute laryngitis and tracheitis J05 Acute obstructive laryngitis [croup] and epiglottitis J06 Acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites J09 Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses J10 Influenza due to other identified influenza virus J11 Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus J12 Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified J13 Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae J14 Pneumonia due to Hemophilus influenzae J15 Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified J16 Pneumonia due to other infectious organisms, not elsewhere classified J17 Pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere J18 Pneumonia, unspecified organism J20 Acute bronchitis J21 Acute bronchiolitis J22 Unspecified acute lower respiratory infection J32 Chronic sinusitis J36 Peritonsillar abscess J40 Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic J85 Abscess of lung and mediastinum J86 Pyothorax J90 Pleural effusion, not elsewhere classified N30 Cystitis N39 Other disorders of urinary system R05 Cough R50 Fever of other and unknown origin Additionally, any visit or hospital admission associated with NCSP procedural codes in Table 4.2) were extracted.

A separate unique identification number was provided for each individual visit or hospital admission. Several smaller data-sets pertaining to specific papers were extracted from the inpatient registry. These smaller data-sets were not linked to the main study data. For paper I, all doses of ceftriaxone administered at the Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 2009 and December 2015 were extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. Any ICD-10 diagnostic code associated with the visit or hospital admission in which ceftriaxone was administered, was extracted from the inpatient registry. Importantly, this included all ICD-10 codes, not only those in Table 4.1. The aggregate number of yearly visits to the paediatric emergency department of Children’s Hospital Iceland 2008-2015 was also obtained for use in paper I. Paper VI required synthetic controls used within a time-series analysis framework. The aggregate monthly number of acute-care visits and hospital admissions for several sub-chapters of the ICD-10 diagnostic coding system (Table @ref(tab:table-icd_synthetic))) were obtained for 22 different age-groups. Table 4.3: NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures codes used in the current study ICD-10 code Description A10-B99 Certain infectious and parasitic diseases C00-D48 Neoplasms D50-89 Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism E00-99 Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases G00-G99 Diseases of the nervous system H00-99 Diseases of the eye and adnexa, Diseases of the ear and mastoid process I00-99 Diseases of the circulatory system K00-99 Diseases of the digestive system L00-99 Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue M00-99 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue N00-99 Diseases of the genitourinary system P00-99 Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period Q00-99 Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities R00-99 Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified S00-T99 Provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology U00-99 Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes V00-Y99 External causes of morbidity Z00-99 Factors influencing health status and contact with health services Data from the inpatient registry was used in papers I, IV, V and VI. 4.1.3 The Primary Care Registry In the Icelandic healthcare system, primary care is provided by family medicine physicians at 69 neighborhood based centers (Heilsugæsla). All primary care centers use the same electronic medical record system, and the same diagnostic coding systems (NCSP, ICD-10) as Landspitali University Hospital and Children’s Hospital Iceland. The Directorate of Health maintains a registry on all primary care visits within the Icelandic healthcare system. Due to extensive maintenance and restructuring ongoing since early 2016, no new data has been added to the registry since December 31, 2015. From this registry, all visits and phone-calls with ICD-10 diagnostic codes compatible with respiratory tract infections were extracted for the period January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2015 (Table 4.1). 4.1.4 The National Vaccine Registry The Icelandic Directorate of Health also maintains the National Vaccine Registry (NVR). All vaccine doses administered within the healthcare system are systematically recorded in an individual’s electronic health record at the time of administration. This record is reviewed and updated regularly, and vaccinations received elsewhere are included. The NVR collects this information from all electronic health records in the country. All administered vaccine doses with ATC codes “J07AL” (Pneumococcal vaccines) were extracted for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017. 4.1.5 The National Drug Prescription Registry The national drug prescription registry (NDPR) is a whole population registry, collected and maintained by the Icelandic Directorate of Health since January 1, 2005. It contains information on all filled drug prescriptions in Iceland. All pharmacies are required by law to collect data on each filled prescription and submit to the NDPR. An important distinction must be made between a filled prescription and a prescription. The NDPR receives information if and when a prescription is filled. It does not contain information on prescriptions that were never filled by the patient. All prescriptions contained within the NDPR were paid for and received by the patient. Extensive validation and error testing has been performed by the Directorate of Health to ensure the robustness of the NDPR. Automated electronic submissions, coupled with tightly controlled processes by which pharmacies dispense drugs, has essentially excluded the possiblity of any filled prescriptions escaping registration. All prescriptions within the ATC therapeutic subgroup “J01” (Antibacterials for Systemic Use), “J07” (Vaccines), “S01” (Opthalmologicals) and “S02” (Otologicals) were extracted for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017. The chemical subgroups used in the study are shown in Table 4.4) Table 4.4: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes used in the current study ATC chemical subgroup code Description J01A Tetracyclines J01B Amphenicols J01C Beta-lactam antibacterials, penicillins J01D Other beta-lactam antibacterials J01E Sulfonamides and trimethoprim J01F Macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins J01G Aminoglycoside antibacterials J01M Quinolone antibacterials J01R Combinations of antibacterials J01X Other antibacterials J07A Bacterial vaccines J07B Viral vaccines J07C Bacterial and viral vaccines J07X Other vaccines S01A, S02A Anti-infectives S01C, S02C Anti-inflammatory agents and anti-infectives in combination 4.1.6 Reimbursement database of Icelandic Health Insurance The healthcare system in Iceland is a single-payer system with one government-run health insurance provider, under which all permanent citizens are covered. Each healthcare visit requires a nominal out-of-pocket fee, with the rest of the visit covered by the insurance. Healthcare providers are either salaried governmental employees, or independent practitioners who are reimbursed on a per case basis, according to pre-determined negotiations with Icelandic Health Insurance. To receive pay for services, physicians must submit a reimbursement form detailing the nature of the visit and any procedures performed using pre-specified procedural codes. Icelandic Health Insurance maintains a reimbursement database which details the nature and number of procedures performed.

Treatment of otitis media with ceftriaxone was used as a proxy for treatment failure. Ceftriaxone use for other diagnoses and in older children was used as a comparator. All children under eighteen years of age who visited Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015 were included. Children’s Hospital Iceland’s referral area was defined as a 100km driving distance from the hospital. Population demographic data for the referral area was obtained from Statistics Iceland (www.statice.is). Data were extracted from Landspitali University Hospital’s inpatient registry. A visit was included in the study if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) was documented in the medical record, or if a child received one or more doses of ceftriaxone. All administered doses of ceftriaxone were systematically extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. The ICD-10 diagnoses associated with the ceftriaxone administrations were then obtained from the inpatient registry. The total number of visits per calendar year and month regardless of diagnosis was provided by the hospital. Pre-vaccine (2008-2011) and post-vaccine (2012-2015) periods were defined based on the year of vaccine introduction. Because hospital visits for otitis media are uncommon in older children, the primary analysis was restricted to children under four years of age. Ceftriaxone use was analysed in three separate diagnostic groups; otitis media, pneumonia and other , based on the associated ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Ceftriaxone was considered to be due to otitis media, if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) were recorded, and due to pneumonia if ICD-10 codes Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) or Pneumonia, unspecified organism (J18) were recorded. Visits associated with ceftriaxone administration that did not fall into either of the above categories were classified together as “Other”. The number of ceftriaxone treatment episodes per diagnostic group were aggregated by calendar month. An episode was considered distinct if no ceftriaxone administration was documented in the previous fourteen days. Incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-years were calculated by dividing the monthly number of ceftriaxone episodes per diagnostic group by the person-time of children in the referral area. The IR of OM visits were similarly defined and calculated. If a decrease were to be observed in the number of ceftriaxone treated OM episodes, it could be due to either a decrease in the number of OM visits or a decrease in the use of ceftriaxone. To evaluate this, the incidence risk of ceftriaxone treatment per 1,000 OM visits was calculated for the pre- and post-vaccine periods. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.4.4. (R Core Team 2018) using the epiR package (Stevenson et al. 2017). Incidence rate ratios (\\(IRR\\)) were calculated between the pre- and post-vaccine periods and were estimated independently for each age-strata. The stratum-specific estimates were combined (when appropriate) using the Mantel-Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals calculated using the delta procedure (Kirkwood and Sterne 2003). The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the incidence rate ratio (\\(IRR_{MH}\\)) is the weighted mean of the \\(IRR\\) in each stratum. The null-hypothesis that \\(IRR_{MH} = 1\\) was tested by calculating the Mantel-Haenszel \\(\\chi^2\\) test statistic, from which the P-value was derived. Combining sratum-specific estimates is appropriate when the exposure-outcome association is the same in each of the strata, i.e. \\(IRR_{age} = IRR_{MH}\\) The \\(\\chi^2\\) test of heterogeneity tests whether the data is congruent with the null hypothesis of no effect modification of the exposure-outcome relationship by strata. The greater the differences is between \\(IRR_{age}\\) and \\(IRR_{MH}\\), the larger the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the \\(IRR_{MH}\\) is not calculated and only the stratum-specific \\(IRR\\) are presented. 4.3 Paper 2 Paper 2 is a whole-population observational cohort study that followed all children born in Iceland between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2015, from birth until three years of age, death or end of the study period. All primary care visits in which an ICD-10 diagnostic code of suppurative otitis media (H66) was recorded were included. Any visits occuring within 30 days of a previously documented visit by the same child were excluded from the main analysis. Data were obtained from the Primary Care Registry of the Icelandic Directorate of Health, and included all ICD-10 codes associated with the visit, as well as the date of the visit, age and gender of the child, and physician identification number. The study identification number used to identify unique individuals is directly derived from the national indentification numbers issued to each individual by the government. Individuals who had immigrated to Iceland after birth were excluded. Demographic population data was obtained from Statistics Iceland. Cohorts were defined based on year of birth, or vaccine eligibility. Birth-cohorts 2005–2010 were grouped as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC) and birth-cohorts 2011–2015 as vaccine eligible cohorts (VEC). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. (R Core Team 2018) using the R packages; survival (Therneau 2017), RMS [@-rms] and epiR (Stevenson et al. 2017). Crude incidence rates (\\(IR\\)) were calculated per 100 person-years at risk for each birth cohort, stratified by four-month age brackets. The individual time at-risk was carefully constructed to exclude the 30 days following each recorded otitis media visit. This avoided including the period in which it was impossible for a visit to be recorded due to the study design. Crude incidence rate ratios (\\(IRR\\)) between VNEC and VEC were calculated and confidence intervals estimated assuming Poisson variance. In the subset of children who had full follow-up time, the number of children who experienced \\(k = \\{0, 1,...,12\\}\\) episodes of otitis media were tabulated and the distribution between VNEC and VEC compared using the \\(\\chi^2\\) test of homogeneity, Additionally, the crude risk ratio between the VEC and VNEC of experiencing 0, 1–4, or &gt;5 episodes of otitis media before three years of age was calculated. The Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox regression model for repeated events was used to model data on the individual level and to account for censoring of follow-up time (Andersen and Gill 1982). To correct for successive visits by the same individual, Lin and Wei’s sandwich variance estimates were used (Lin and Wei 1989). From this model, the hazard ratio (HR) of otitis media visits between each birth-cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort was caclulated. The impact of PHiD-CV10 on otitis media visits was calculated using 1 – (HR between the last vaccine-eligible birth cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort). The HR between VNEC and VEC was calculated for each number of previous otitis media visits, and the mean number of episodes as a function of age was estimated from the model using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimator (Cook and Lawless 2007). To determine the number of otitis media episodes prevented in the first five years of the vaccination, each child’s follow-up time was multiplied by the Nelson-Aelen estimate of the mean number of episodes. The absolute reduction in the incidence rate was then calculated by dividing the estimated number of prevented episodes with the total person-time of the VEC. 4.4 Paper 3 Paper 3 is a whole population observational cohort study of antimicrobial prescriptions among children under three years of age in Iceland. Eleven consecutive Icelandic birth-cohorts 2005–2015 were followed from birth until three years of age. Children who imigrated to Iceland after birth were excluded. Follow-up time was censored on death, emigration, or end of the study period (December 31, 2016). Due to short follow-up time, the 2016 birth-cohort was not included in the analysis. Data regarding outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions was obtained from the National Drug Prescription Registry, which has been previously described (Table 4.4). Data on primary care visits for respiratory tract infections was collected from the Primary Care Registry using the ICD-10 codes shown in Table 4.1. If a prescription was filled within three days of a documented physician visit by the same child, then the prescription and the visit were linked. Because data from the Primary Care Registry was only available through December 31, 2015, the portion of the analysis partaining to the linked data was restricted to that date. Population demographical data was acquired from Statistics Iceland (https://www.statice.is/). Birth-cohorts were compared individually or grouped by vaccine eligibility. Individual birth-cohorts were each compared to the last vaccine non-eligible cohort. Birth-cohorts 2011–2015 were grouped as the vaccine-eligible cohorts (VEC) and birth-cohorts 2005–2010 as the vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC). Aggregate analyses by calendar year were performed for all children under three years of age. Antimicrobials were classified into six classes; first and second line penicillins, first and second generation macrolides, cephalosporins and others. The proportion of antimicrobial prescriptions in each class was calculated by calendar year. Similarly, the proportion of primary care visits resulting in antimicrobial prescription in each calendar year was calculated by indication. Five groups were defined based on ICD-10 discharge diagnosis; Acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), Other acute lower respiratory infections (J20-J22), AOM (H65, H66 and H72) and Other viral infections (B34). Incidence rates (IR) per 100 person-years at risk for each of the study birth-cohorts were calculated in six-month age-groups and 95% confidence intervals estimated using the Wald method. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) between the VNEC and the VEC were estimated and 95% confidence intervals calculated assuming Poisson variance. The cumulative proportion of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions by three years of age was compared between VNEC and VEC using the Chi-squared test of homogeneity. For this analysis, the 2014 and 2015-cohorts were excluded as they did not have the full three-year follow-up time. The cumulative number of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions per child was stratified into brackets &lt; 1, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14 and ≥ 15 and the incidence risk ratio between VNEC and VEC was calculated for each bracket. The Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox regression model for repeated events was used to model the individual level data and allow for censored follow-up times. The model included age as the underlying measure of time to directly correct for age and was stratified allowing different baseline-hazards for each gender. The cumulative number of previous antimicrobial prescriptions was included as a covariate and modelled using a restricted cubic spline relationship. Finally, birth-cohort membership was included as a categorical variable. Robust sandwich variance estimates were included to account for correlation between successive observations of the same child. The model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of antimicrobial prescription between each of the study birth-cohorts and the reference birth-cohort. The vaccine impact of PHiD-CV10 in reducing outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions was then estimated as 1 – (the hazard ratio between the last vac- cine eligible cohort and the reference cohort) × 100%. The vaccine impact against each successive prescription was estimated by calculating the hazard ratio of antimicrobial prescription between VEC and VNEC for each number of previous prescriptions. Finally, the mean number of antimicrobial prescriptions for each gender and vaccine-cohort was calculated as a function of age using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimate. This was used to estimate the absolute number of prevented antimicrobial prescriptions during the first seven years of the intervention by adding together the expected number of prescriptions per child using the VNEC estimate of the mean and subtracting the expected number of prescriptions per child using the VEC estimate of the mean. The absolute rate reduction was calculated by dividing this estimate with the number of person-years at-risk in the VEC. A sub-analysis was performed to estimate the vaccine impact against AOM-associated antimicrobial prescriptions. The same regression methodology was applied to a subset of the prescriptions which were linked to a primary care physician visit with a diagnosis of AOM. Vaccine impact was similarly estimated as 1 – (the hazard ratio between the last vaccine eligible cohort and the reference cohort) × 100% References "],
["results.html", "5 Results 5.1 Paper 1", " 5 Results 5.1 Paper 1 During the period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2015, 103,220 visits were recorded to the Children’s Hospital. The number of visits showed marked seasonal variation. More visits were recorded during the winter months than during the summer months. (#fig:figure_monthly_visits)Monthly number of visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland The total number of visits grew steadily from 12,229 in 2008 to 14,502 in 2015. During the same period, 4,624 children &lt;4 years of age visited the Children’s Hospital 6,232 times for the treatment of 4,994 distinct episodes of AOM, of which 531 episodes were treated with ceftriaxone. The number of children &lt;18 years of age living within the Children’s Hospital’s referral region was stable during the study period decreasing from 62,067 in 2008 to 61,798 in 2015. The number of children &lt;4 years of age in the same region increased from 13,562 in 2008 to 14,644 in 2011 and then decreased again to 13,272 in 2015. Raw incidence rates of total visits, visits for AOM and parenteral ceftriaxone use are shown. The percentage of children &lt;4 years of age who had received ≥2 doses of PHiD-CV10 by December of each year was 0.4% in 2008, 0.9% in 2009, 2.3% in 2010, 8.6% in 2011, 38% in 2012, 68% in 2013, 93% in 2014 and 97% in 2015. A total of 97% of children born in Iceland in 2011 later received at least 2 doses of PHiD-CV10. Rate Visits for distinct episodes of AOM decreased significantly after vaccination from an incidence rate of 47.5 per 1000 person- years in the prevaccine period to an incidence rate of 33.9 per 1000 person-years postvaccine. The effect of vaccine period varied sig- nificantly across age strata precluding Mantel–Haenzel adjustment. The crude overall IRR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81–0.91; P &lt; 0.001). A significant decrease in visits was observed only in children 2–3 years of age (IRR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.63–0.80; P &lt; 0.001. A nonsig- nificant trend toward a decrease was observed in other age strata. Children 0–1 and 3–4 years of age visited the Children’s Hospital because of episodes of AOM for a total of only 481 and 396 times, respectively, Significantly fewer episodes of AOM were treated with ceftriaxone in the postvaccine period compared with those in the prevaccine period (Table 1). The effect was consistent across age strata with an overall Mantel–Haenzel adjusted IRR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.37–0.54; P &lt; 0.001). During the entire study period, only 16 epi- sodes of AOM in children 0–1 year of age, and 20 episodes in chil- dren 3–4 years of age, were treated with ceftriaxone. Age-specific incidence rates and incidence rate ratios are shown in Table 2. The relative risk of treatment with ceftriaxone if presenting to the Chil- dren’s Hospital with AOM decreased significantly after vaccination. The effect was consistent across age strata with a Mantel–Haenzel adjusted relative risk ratio of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.44–0.63; P &lt; 0.001. Episodes of pneumonia treated with ceftriaxone also decreased overall, from 251 treatment episodes in the prevaccine period to 90 in the postvaccine period, with a Mantel–Haenzel adjusted IRR 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28–0.45; P &lt; 0.001. This signifi- cant decrease was observed in all age strata. Ceftriaxone use for other indications in children &lt;4 years of age did not decrease sig- nificantly, with an IRR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.84–1.02; P = 0.13. Age- specific incidence rates and incidence rate ratios by indication for each vaccine period are shown in Table 2. Quarterly incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes by indication is shown in Figure 1. An overall decrease in incidence rate of ceftriaxone use in children &lt;18 years of age regardless of indication was noted at the Children’s Hospital Iceland after PHiD-CV10 introduction, from 0.93 treatment episodes per 1000 person-years in the prevaccine period to 0.80 in the postvaccine period with a crude overall IRR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81–0.91; P &lt; 0.001). However, when analyzed by age group, this is exclusively because of a significant decrease in incidence rate of ceftriaxone use in children 0–3 years of age (IRR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.67–0.79; P &lt; 0.001). Ceftriaxone use did not decrease significantly in other age groups, and there was a trend toward increasing use in children 12–17 years of age (Figure 2). "],
