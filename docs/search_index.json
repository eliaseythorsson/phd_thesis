I am writing the thesis in Rstudio using the bookdown package and hosting the thesis on Github. Writing the thesis in Rstudio confers many advantages. Tables and Figures can be created directly within Rstudio, which minimizes additional work associated with manually moving them into a separate writing program – a process both error-prone and labor intensive. All aspects of the writing, typesetting and data analysis are documented and version controlled. The bookdown packages automates the process of exporting the thesis to word, pdf and html formats. The thesis will be open access during the writing process. I believe I will be more motivated if my productiveness – or lack thereof, is held accountable to anyone who wishes to check. I would be grateful for any and all comments on any aspect of the thesis under construction. "],

It is also a common pathogen, and one of the most common bacterial causes of disease in humans. In classical medical texts, pneumococcus is described as a Gram-positive lancet-shaped coccus, usually found in pairs. In fact, pneumococcus is the Gram-positive coccus, being the first bacteria noted by Christian Gram that retained the dark aniline-gentian violet stain that now bears his name (Gram 1884). Pneumococcus was first isolated in 1881 by two microbiologist, George M. Sternberg in the United States and Louis Pasteur in France (Pasteur 1881; Sternberg 1882; Watson et al. 1993). The causal association between this newly discovered bacterium and pneumonia was firmly established only five years later (Weichselbaum 1886), and in the following decade, all clinical presentations of pneumococcal infection had been described (Austrian 1981). The infectious manifestations of pneumococcal disease are, broadly speaking, local infections of the respiratory tract and infections of previously sterile tissue. They range from common to uncommon, and from benign to serious. The most common infectious manifestation of pneumococcus is otitis media (AOM) – an infection of the middle ear. The disease course is benign and rarely results in permanent disability. On the other hand, AOM is the most common reason for physician visit and for antimicrobial prescription in the paediatric population. Antimicrobial consumption is causally related to antimicrobial resistance, a major threat to public health. Recurrent or persistent otitis media is sometimes treated with the surgical placement of tympanic tubes, rendering it the most common surgical procedure in children. Thus, while AOM is a benign disease, it is associated with a large healthcare burden. A potentially more serious manifestation of penumococcal disease is pneumonia, the disease from which pneumococcus gets its name. Pneumonia often requires hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial treatment, and can lead to permanent disability and death. Pneumococcus can cause invasive infections if it gains access to normally sterile tissue. These includes bacteremia, an infection of the blood, and meningitis, an infection of the meninges. These infectious manifestations are grouped together as invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Whilst IPD is extremely uncommon, the consequences can be disastrous. The case-fatality ratio from pneumococcal meningitis in Iceland is estimated at 15.3%. Pneumococcal infections are responsible for a large healthcare burden that spans the range from outpatient to inpatient treatment. For over a century, scientists have attempted to prevent pneumococcal disease using vaccines with varying results. Pneumococcal vaccine development is complicated by the polysaccharide coating that protects pneumococcus from environmental factors. The polysaccharide capsule acts as an “invisibility cloak” to the human immune system, rendering it unable to detect pneumococcus except through certain patterns in the oligosaccharides contained within the capsule (Tuomanen, Austrian, and Masure 1995). Based on these patterns, pneumococcus has been classified into over 97 different serotypes to date. As the capsule contains only polysaccharides and not proteins, the immune response is T-cell independent and therefore poorly immunogenic, even after being identified by the immune system (Geno et al. 2015). The epidemiology of pneumococcus is dominated by person-to-person transmission of asymptomatic carriage. Because children have no previous immunity to any serotype, they are colonized by pneumococcus more frequently, and each colonization lasts longer (MELEGARO, GAY, and MEDLEY 2004). This phenomenon is further augmented when multiple immune-naive children congregate, such as in daycare centers and pre-schools (Yagupsky et al. 1998). Thus children act as a pneumococcal reservoir for the population, without actually having any clinical disease (Hoshino et al. 2002; Le Polain de Waroux et al. 2014; Mosser et al. 2014). Vaccinating children against certain serotypes may therefore lead to a decrease in pneumococcal disease caused by those serotypes in adults. In vaccine epidemiology, this is referred to as herd-effect and is an important consideration for pneumococcal vaccine development. Serotype replacement can also occur, where previously rare serotypes appear and fill the ecological niche vacated by the vaccine serotypes. Health systems operate under constraints on budgets and resources. Demonstrating vaccine benefit is essential, but not the only factor to consider when making health policy decisions. Cost and resource allocation are also of crucial importance. This is especially complicated in the case of vaccines, because benefits are not seen immediately but rather over time. Benefits occur in both vaccinated and unvaccinated members of the population. The diseases prevented by vaccines have associated expenses which must be accounted for when the expenditures for a vaccine program are evaluated. Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis are methods developed to measure the ratio between expenditure and benefit, and are used as a tool in making health policy decisions. To adequately perform such an analyses, detailed data on disease incidence and associated costs for the whole population must be available. Iceland is an independent island nation, isolated in the mid-Atlantic, with a homogeneous population of roughly 330,000 individuals. The first systematic program of vaccination against pneumococcus in Iceland began in April 2011, when the 10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influnzae protein-D conjugate vaccine (Synflorix, PHiD-CV10) was introduced into the national paediatric vaccination program. The vaccine program entailed two primary doses given at three and five months of age, and a booster dose at twelve months. No catch-up program was undertaken. Prior to the introduction, no systematic vaccination effort had been undertaken in Iceland. As the other Nordic countries, Iceland has a rich legacy of national health-related registers. Detailed individual-level information on vaccine status, outpatient primary care visits, antimicrobial consumption, tympanic tube procedures and hospitalizations are accessible, and linked between registries using national identification numbers. All healthcare costs are available on the individual-level from Icelandic Health Insurance, which is the insurer of all permanent Icelandic residents. This wealth of medical documentation enabled a unique whole-population ecological study examining the impact of systematic pneumococcal vaccination. 2.1 Clinical manifestations of Streptococcus pneumoniae In this chapter the clinical manifestations of pneumococcal disease will be reviewed. The mechanism by which individuals acquire pneumococcus into their normal upper respiratory flora will be discussed, and the association between pneumococcal carriage and disease will be described. Throughout this thesis, attention will be focused on three common clinical presentations of pneumococcal infections; AOM, pneumonia and IPD, including the pathophysiology, natural disease course, and health care burden of each of the presentations. Pneumococcus has gone by many names since it was first isolated in 1881. It was originally named Micrococcus pasteuri by Sternberg (Sternberg 1882), but by 1920, a scientific consensus was reached that the official name should be Diplococcus pneumoniae (Winslow et al. 1920). It was not until 1974 that pneumococcus received its current name, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Deibel and Seeley 1974). Because pneumococcus is both a commensal bacterium and a pathogen, its relationship with humans is complex. Most children are colonized by pneumococcus within the first months of life (Leino et al. 2001). The serotype distribution of the initial colonization in a child is influenced by the distribution of serotypes within the child’s family. Over the course of the their lifetime, a child will be colonized by many different serotypes. Their immune system will learn to recognize newly acquired serotypes and will either clear the colonization or maintain an equilibrium in which the serotype is kept within a certain limit of reproduction (Dowling, Sheehe, and Feldman 1971; MELEGARO, GAY, and MEDLEY 2004). In this manner, the contribution of pneumococcus to the human upper respiratory flora is in a state of constant flux. New serotypes enter while the old exit, and the relative density of serotypes changes. In some cases, the equilibrium between pneumococcus and the host is destabilized, triggering a rapid growth of pneumococcus and resulting in clinical manifestations. It is thought that this is most likely to occur directly following the acquisition of new serotype into the nasopharyngeal flora (Casey, Adlowitz, and Pichichero 2009). Because pneumococcus is carried in the nasopharynx, this overgrowth results in infections of adjacent tissue; the sinuses, middle ear and conjunctiva. The pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia is thought to occur through micro-aspiration of upper respiratory secretions, provoking a subsequent rapid proliferation of pneumococcus in the lower respiratory tract. Invasive disease occurs when pneumococcus penetrates the host’s immunological defenses and proliferates in normally sterile tissue. This can occur as a primary event, or can be secondary to infections of the upper or lower respiratory tract. Generally, IPD is considered to encompass meningitis, bacteraemia and septic arthritis. While some may argue that the middle ear is normally sterile, AOM is not considered invasive disease. 2.1.1 Acute otitis media Otitis media is an inflammatory state of the middle ear. It is most often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The clinical presentation of otitis media is variable. Its onset ranges from abrupt to gradual, and its duration from short to protracted. Several categories have been defined to facilitate communication concerning this variability. They are not mutually exclusive, but rather represent a continuum of the disease process. Otitis media can manifest as a acute inflammatory event. This is the classical AOM with which most parents are familiar. AOM can be recurrent, which is defined as AOM occurring three times over a six month period, or four or more times over a twelve month period. Conversely, it can take the form of a chronic low-grade process. The later phenotype includes otitis media with effusion and chronic suppurative otitis media. Otitis media with effusion is defined as the protracted collection of serous fluid in the middle ear. By convention, it is considered to be present if middle ear effusion has been documented to have lasted for three months or longer. It may follow AOM, or be detected without an obvious inciting event. Chronic suppurative otitis media may be thought of as a protracted case of AOM. The child remains sickly and the middle ear is filled with puss. The tympanic membrane often ruptures as a result. The anatomy of the middle ear is intrinsic to the epidemiology of otitis media, and can elucidate the wide range of presentations described above. The middle ear is located within a recess in the tympanic bone, medially to the tympanic membrane. It communicates with the nasopharynx by means of the Eustachian tube, a thin muscular canal that acts to equalize pressure between the middle ear and the external ear. This communication allows viruses and bacteria in the nasopharynx to gain access to the middle ear which clarifies the association between nasopharyngeal carriage and AOM. The Eustachian tube is anatomically shorter and straighter in children, partly accounting for the much higher risk of middle ear infections in children as compared to adults. It is also much thinner. Because of this, any cause of inflammation in the nasopharynx can lead to a spasm of a child’s Eustachian tube, resulting in the build up of secretions in the middle ear. These secretions provide optimal conditions for bacterial growth and can lead to subsequent otitis media. They can also remain macroscopically uninfected, which, if lasting long enough, would be categorized as otitis media with effusion. The anatomic view also helps to explain the mechanism of the contribution of different risk factors. The cycle of Eustachian tube dysfunction, effusion and increased risk of infection was the catalyst for the development of tympanic tube placements as a treatment for middle ear infections in children. By providing a secondary mechanism by which the middle ear could drain and equalize pressure, the rationale was that propensity for infection would decrease. 2.1.1.1 Pathogens implicated in acute otitis media Any pathogen that is able to gain access to the middle ear, disrupt the normal function of the Eustachian tube and replicate within the resulting fluid, has the potential to cause otitis media. In upwards of 90% of otitis media cases, the bacteria aspirated from the middle ear fluid will also be found in the nasopharynx (Casey, Adlowitz, and Pichichero 2009). The most common bacterial causes of otitis media are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis (Bluestone, Stephenson, and Martin 1992; Casey and Pichichero 2004; Casey, Adlowitz, and Pichichero 2009; Ngo et al. 2016; Pumarola et al. 2013). The relative contribution of these three pathogens is remarkably stable between countries and over time. This is likely a consequence of how common they are in the nasopharyngeal flora of children. A systematic review of studies from 1970-2014 which reported the etiology of otitis media, found that Streptococcus pneumoniae caused 30.2% of AOM in Europe (Ngo et al. 2016). In countries that have introduced systematic pneumococcal vaccination, there is evidence to suggest that the microbiology of otitis media has shifted from being predominantly due to pneumococcus to Haemophilus influenzae (Block et al. 2004; Van Dyke et al. 2017). Of the pneumococcal AOM, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes has decreased and non-vaccine serotypes now predominate. Children with otitis media who experience spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane have a slightly different distribution of pathogens, with a higher proportion of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (Chen et al. 2013; Sonsuwan, Watcharinyanon, and Sawanyawisuth 2016). This could be explained by these pathogens causing a more aggressive infection, or possibly by contamination by bacteria located in the external ear canal. Similarly, coagulase negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus are more common in otitis media with effusion (Kim et al. 2013). Pneumococcal otitis media is slightly more likely to lead to recurrent otitis media and chronic suppurative otitis media, but is otherwise clinically indistinguishable from otitis media caused by other otopathogens. 2.1.1.2 Healthcare burden of otitis media The healthcare burden caused by otitis media is disproportionate to its severity. Acute otitis media is the most common reason for physician visit among children, a fact which has been frequently documented in multiple countries. Only focusing on physician visits underestimates the impact of AOM, as some episodes are not reported to physicians but still result in distressing symptoms in children and parental missed days of work. By a child’s third birthday, 60%-80% will have experienced at least one episode of AOM (Kaur, Morris, and Pichichero 2017; Teele, Klein, and Rosner 1989). Likewise, otitis media is also responsible for the majority of antimicrobial prescriptions, and thus contributes significantly to antimicrobial resistance. Though often benign and self-limiting, AOM can progress to recurrent or chronic infection and require more invasive treatment. Mastoiditis develops in XXX% of cases and will require hospital admission and administration of intravenous antimicrobials. Severe AOM can result in hearing loss and has been estimated to occur XXX%. 2.1.1.3 Tympanostomy tube procedures For various reasons, parents and clinicians may opt to treat recurrent or chronic otitis media with the placement of a tympanic tube. Tympanic tube procedures are consequently the most common surgical procedure in the paediatric population (Black 1984; Cullen, Hall, and Golosinskiy 2009). Despite their popularity, there is little evidence for the use of tympanostomy tubes for their two most common indications; recurrent otitis media and hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (Venekamp et al. 2018; Browning et al. 2010). Inconsistent evidence regarding the efficacy of tympanostomy tube procedures is mirrored in the large variation in incidence that is seen both within and between different countries. In Sweden, the incidence of procedures is low, and was in 1996, estimated to be 10 per 1000 person-years (Florentzson and Finizia 2012). The incidence was 5.6-6.7 procedures per 1000 person-years in Australia (Spilsbury et al. 2006). Even within the United States, there are large variations in the incidence. In 1988, the prevalence rate of tympanostomy tube placements among children younger than eighteen in the United States was estimated to be 13% (95%CI 11%-14%) (Bright et al. 1993). In Northern New England alone, the incidence varied between different paediatric surgical areas, from 3.79 to 13.15 procedures per 1000 person-years (Parker et al. 2016). The variation can possibly be explained by different thresholds for performing the procedure. By carefully examining the medical records of all children who underwent tympanic tube procedures in five hospitals in New York, Keyhani et al. were able to show that 92% of the procedures would not have been recommended according to the guidelines in force at the time of surgery (Keyhani et al. 2008). 2.1.1.4 Acute otitis media in Iceland The incidence AOM, its microbiology, treatment and complications have been evaluated in Iceland. In 1990, a retrospective analysis of two birth-cohorts in a small village in Iceland showed a 66% cumulative incidence of AOM by 24 months of age (Bjarnason, Friðriksson, and Benediktsson 1991). A larger study conducted in 1998 used parental questionnaires to estimate the incidence of upper respiratory infections that resulted in antimicrobial treatment and tympanic tube placements among children ages one to six years old (Arason et al. 2002). A total of 1030 children were randomly sampled from four geographically separated areas of Iceland and the study achieved a 78% response rate. The study demonstrated high incidence rates of antimicrobially treated AOM for all age-groups, ranging from 1.79 treatment episodes among children one year of age to 0.25 treatment episodes in children six years of age. In this random sample, 58% of all antimicrobial prescriptions were due to AOM. The cumulative incidence of tympanic tube placements was alarmingly high. By one year of age, 23% (95%CI 16%-31%) had already received at least one tympanostomy tube. This proportion exceeded 30% by age two and remained fairly stable thereafter. The study was repeated by the same investigators in 2003 using the exact same cross-sectional random sampling (Arason et al. 2005). The proportion of all antimicrobial prescriptions that were due to AOM was almost exactly the same, 57%. Surprisingly, the cumulative incidence of tympanostomy tube placement had slightly increased and was now estimated to be 34%, 2.1.2 Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as the infectious infiltration of the lung parenchyma. Several different classification systems have been proposed to aid in the treatment of pneumonia (Mackenzie 2016). Some are based on the anatomical distribution of infectious infiltrates on radiographs, others on the symptomotology and still others on the distribution of risk factors in those being diagnosed with the disease. Each attempts to utilize readily available information to assist in selecting among treatment options and in predicting prognosis. While the ideal classification system would be based on the antimicrobial susceptibility of the causative pathogen, this information is rarely available when treatment decisions are being made. Most commonly, pneumonia is classified by assigning cases based upon the circumstances under which it was diagnosed. Pneumonia is classified as community acquired pneumonia if it is detected in people with limited contact with the healthcare system in the weeks prior to diagnosis. This is the most common type of pneumonia. Remaining pneumonia cases are classified as healthcare associated pneumonia, or hospital-acquired pneumonia if diagnosed during a hospital admission. This simple classification system is remarkably good at predicting antimicrobial resistance in the causative pathogen, and informs the choice of antimicrobial agents. The mechanism by which pathogens gain access to the lung and replicate there causing infection, is best understood by reviewing the pulmonary anatomy. The pulmonary system has an inverted tree configuration. The trachea acts as the trunk and subdivides into the main-stem bronchi, which lead to the right and left lung, respectively. The respiratory tree further subdivides into lobar and segmental bronchi, each of which supplies an independent anatomical segment of the lung, separated by connective tissue. Each compartment is known as a bronchopulmonary segment, and can be individually infected. Within each bronchopulmonary segment, these branches divide 18-20 more times, their diameter decreasing with every division. The final 16-22 divisions compromise the respiratory bronchioles which lead to the alveoli. To infect the lung, a pathogen must first arrive there. While this may seem like an easy task as gravity aids in the aspiration of upper respiratory secretions, it is, in fact, not a simple matter. As anyone who has experienced “food going down the wrong way” knows, the respiratory tree does not readily tolerate backward flow into the lungs. Irritation of the bronchi results in a cough, a powerful, coordinated neuromuscular response which propels any aspirated material up the respiratory tree. Pathogens are prevented from spreading downwards in a more insidious manner, by a constant flow of mucus from the the terminal bronchioles to the upper respiratory tract. The epithelial lining is covered with cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that relentlessly sweep the mucus upwards. Even when pathogens overcome this obstacle and progress down the respiratory tree, they are met with a heavy concentration of defensive immune tissue, the amount of which increases with every division of the respiratory tree. Risk factors of pneumonia are also best explained by referring to the defensive mechanisms employed by the respiratory tree. Processes which interfere with the cough reflex will result in a higher risk of pneumonia. These includes sensory deficiencies present in certain diseases and in the extremes of age, which result in the absence of cough initiation and muscular weakness. Pain associated with fractured ribs can also lead to voluntary suppression of the cough reflex and increases the risk of pneumonia. Another process increases the risk of pneumonia is damage to the respiratory cilia and the resulting stasis of mucus. Cilia damage can result from viral infection or from the inhalation of toxic particles, such as pollution or cigarette smoke, both of which can also cause local immune suppression, further compromising the lung’s defenses. 2.1.2.1 Pathogens causing pneumonia Any pathogen that is able to gain access to the lung and replicate there, has the potential to cause pneumonia. As is the case of otitis media, the most common bacterial pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influnzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (Rodrigues and Groves 2017). Here again, this is most likely to be a function of how common these pathogens are in the upper respiratory flora. Unlike otitis media however, it is exceedingly difficult to determine the causative pathogen in the case of pneumonia (Cilloniz et al. 2016; Feikin et al. 2017). Ideally, a sample would be taken from the lung itself, but the dangers of such procedures which moreover require highly trained personnel and technical resources, render this option unfeasible. Most studies, therefore, use proxy measures such as sputum, blood cultures and nasopharyngeal swabs. In addition, the inability of children to produce a quality sputum sample exacerbates the difficulties of elucidating the causative pathogen (Rodrigues and Groves 2017). The relative contribution of pathogens varies greatly with the age and risk factor profile. Only a few studies in developed countries have evaluated the distribution of pathogens which cause pneumonia in children, but they consistently demonstrate the importance of viruses in paediatric pneumonia. These results may either indicate that viruses are either the primary etiological factor, or that viruses weaken the respiratory defenses and allow bacterial disease to develop. The considerable heterogeneity in the proportion of pneumonias found to be caused by various pathogens, underscores the importance of study population, time-period and, most importantly, the methods used in determining the causative pathogen (Feikin et al. 2017). A large multicenter study, The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH), is underway to clarify the etiology of paediatric pneumonia (Levine et al. 2012). Its results have not yet been published. One of the first prospective studies of paediatric pneumonia was undertaken in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from 1963 to 1971. The study investigated all lower respiratory infections in children, and found most to be caused by respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Glezen and Denny 1973). The predominance of causative viruses is likely due to the methods, current at the time, used to detect etiology. Following the advent of pneumococcal antibody testing, the recognition of pneumococcus as an important pathogen increased. Using pneumococcal antigens, Paisley et al. found pneumococcus to be a contributor to 19% of paediatric pneumonias from 1978-1979 (PAISLEY et al. 1984). In a study conducted in Göteborg, Sweden from 1982-1983, a primitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine etiology, and found that 13% of paediatric pneumonias were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (CLAESSON et al. 1989). In that study, however, antibody testing for pneumococcus was only performed on those who were found to be pneumococcal carriers by nasopharyngeal swap. A few years later, in 1989, a prospective study of paediatric pneumonia in Turku, Finland demonstrated pneumococcus to be a causative pathogen in 38% of cases (Ruuskanen et al. 1992). Another etiological study in Paris in 1992-1994, enrolled 104 consecutive children who presented with pneumonia to a single hospital. Of those, 14% were found to have pneumococcal pneumonia (Gendrel et al. 1997). In populations where pneumococcal vaccination is universal, two studies on the etiology of paediatric pneumonia have been published. One of these, conducted in the United Kingdom in 2009-2011, found pneumococcus to be causative in 17.4% of cases (Elemraid et al. 2013). Another is a large prospective study of 2,358 children conducted in 2011-2012 in the United states, which utilized a variety of sampling methods, and detected pneumococcus in only 4% of cases, a result considerably different than all other etiological studies of paediatric pneumonia (Jain et al. 2015). The authors’ discussion of possible reasons for this included speculation that low proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia might be due to universal pneumococcal vaccination. All of the above studies identified respiratory syncytial virus to be the most common causative pathogen. Of the bacterial pneumonias, all but one found pneumococcus to be the most common. Their interpretation in complicated by the lack of direct sampling from the lungs. In studies that used strict radiological inclusion criteria and used lung aspiration to determine the etiology, pneumococcal pneumonia was by far the most common pathogen (Gilani et al. 2012; World Health Organization Pneumonia Vaccine Trial Investigators’ Group 2001). While the etiology of adult pneumonia has been more extensively studied, the same challenges are encountered as in the study of children. The estimated proportion of pneumonia cases caused by different pathogens varies between studies. This may represent a true difference in the underlying study populations or may be a result of different study design and methodology. A recent meta-analysis evaluated all published studies of pneumonia etiology in Europe from 1990-2011, and estimated the crude proportion caused by pneumococcus to be 19.3% (Rozenbaum et al. 2013). Seventy-seven studies were included, and inclusion criteria were strict, considering only radiologically confirmed pneumonia. The crude estimate of the proportion of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae was 19.3%. After adjusting for several variables using a fixed-effects meta-regression model, the estimated proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia in the average Northern European country was 15%. 2.1.2.2 Healthcare burden of pneumonia Lower respiratory infections were, in 2016, estimated to cause 2,38 million deaths worldwide and were the sixth leading cause of death (Troeger et al. 2018). Of those deaths, 652,572 (95%CI 586,475-720,612) were estimated to occur among children under five years of age, making lower respiratory infections the leading cause of death in this age-group. Large variations exist in the incidence, morbidity and mortality of pneumonia between countries. Pneumonia disproportionately affects developing countries, which experience over half of the pneumonia associated mortality. Yet pneumonia is still a large healthcare burden in developed countries, and accounts for 3%-18% of all childhood hospital admissions (Madhi et al. 2012). In developed countries, the incidence of pneumonia in children under five years of age is 34-40 cases per 1000 person-years. 2.1.2.3 Pneumonia in Iceland Paragraph about Icelandic literature and changing epidemiology - Pneumococcal pneumonia prevalence and serotype distribution - Rate of hospitalization, healthcare consumption - Rate of sequelae 2.1.3 Invasive pneumococcal disease ~ 3 -5 pages - Define different presentations of IPD: meningitis, bacteremia, etc. - Epidemiology, both serotype and age - Risk factors - Burden of disease, health care utilization - Severity - Hospitalization rates, ICU rates - Sequelae - Review of Icelandic literature and changing epidemiology - Meningitis, bacteremia, empyema, joint infection prevalence and serotype distribution - Rate of sequelae 2.2 Pneumococcal vaccines In this chapter we will review the history of pneumococcal vaccination to better understand the current vaccine climate. Special attention will be paid to the scientific discourse that led to the recognition of the need for conjugating pneumococcal polysaccharides to a protein carrier. Several key concepts in pneumococcal vaccine epidemiology will be discussed, e.g. herd-effect and serotype-replacement. The scientific literature on the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on AOM, pneumonia and IPD will be reviewed and discussed. Special attention will be paid to issues of study design and statistical methodology and their effect on study interpretation. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies will be reviewed separately. Finally, the evidence will be summarized. 2.2.1 A brief history of pneumococcal vaccination The history of pneumococcal vaccination can be roughly divided into three phases; the inactivated (killed) whole-cell vaccines; the polysaccharide vaccines and the conjugated vaccines. It begins in 1911 when Wright and colleagues attempted to use an inoculation of heat-killed pneumococcus to vaccinate South African miners against pneumococcal pneumonia (Wright et al. 1914). It should be noted however, that in George Sternberg’s original description of pneumococcus in 1881, he observed that rabbits who were injected with saliva mixed with alcohol and quinine died less frequently than those injected with saliva alone, and were later resistant to re-injection with saliva (Austrian 1999; Sternberg 1882). Sternberg had inadvertently immunized the laboratory animals against subsequent infection by injecting killed pneumococci, thus proving the concept 30 years before it was first attempted. The 1911 trial by Wright failed to demonstrate efficacy because the significance of serotypes and serotype specific immunogenicity was not known. In the following two decades, several trials using inactivated whole-cell pneumococcal vaccines were published (Cecil 1918; Lister 1916; Lister and Ordman 1936; Maynard 1913) Due to inconsistencies in study design, the efficacy of whole bacteria pneumococcal vaccines remained fiercely debated at the time, despite some evidence of benefit (Austrian 1999). Following discoveries of the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide capsule in the 1920s and 1930 (Dochez and Avery 1917; Finland 1931; Francis and Tillett 1930; Heidelberger and Avery 1923; Schiemann and Casper 1927), inactivated whole-cell pneumococcal vaccines were soon replaced with polysaccharide vaccines. The first clinical trial of a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was conducted in the 1930s on 29,000 adult males in the American Civilian Conservation Corps using a bivalent vaccine (Ekwurzel et al. 1938). With similar methodological problems of previous trials of the inactivated vaccines, the results were debated. A second large trial was conducted in the late 1930s, using a tetravalent polysaccharide vaccine (Macleod et al. 1945). This trial built upon the experience of the previous trials, and was able to show convincing efficacy against pneumococcal pneumonia, leading to the licensure of two hexavalent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines in the 1940s. One was formulated for adults and the other for children, each optimized to the serotype distribution within the respective age-group. Unfortunately, these early vaccines fell victim to unfavorable timing; in 1944, Tillet and colleagues showed that bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia could be cured by parenteral administration of benzylpenicillin (Tillett, Cambier, and McCormack 1944). With this discovery, the medical community became complacent. The mortality rate of pneumococcal disease decreased sufficiently that there was no longer a perceived need for preventative vaccination. The licenses for the polysaccharide vaccines were withdrawn by the manufacturer due to lack of use (Austrian 1999). Interest in pneumococcal vaccination re-emerged in the 1950s when it was noted that the mortality benefit of penicillin was not ubiquitous. The elderly and those who had underlying disease did not experience a decrease in their case fatality ratio (Austrian and Gold 1964). This led to a redoubled effort to create a new polysaccharide vaccine. Several large randomized controlled trials were conducted in South Africa in the 1970s (Austrian et al. 1976, Smit (1977)) and, on the basis of these, a 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1977. Its valency was increased to 23 polysaccharides in 1983 (Austrian 1999). Early in the development of pneumococcal vaccines, there was an interested in vaccinating children. Two trials were conducted in the early 1980s which tested the use of polysaccharide vaccines in young children. Neither showed benefit (Mäkelä et al. 1981; Sloyer, Ploussard, and Howie 1981). This result was not entirely unexpected. In 1937, The first polysaccharide trial conducted in children failed to detect any immunological response (Davies 1937). Laboratory studies in the 1930s and 1940s revealed that the reason for this lack of efficacy was due to the thymus independent immune response to purely sacharide antigens. These same studies showed that this could be remedied by adding a protein adjuvant, thus inducing a T-cell response. The strategy of protein conjugation saw its first success in the development of the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. Subsequently, several different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines entered phase II and phase III clinical trials in the late 1990s (Austrian 1999). The first of these to receive licensure was the seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, licensed in 2000 in the United States. It included the purified polysaccharides of seven serotypes of pneumococcus (4, 9V, 14, 19F, 23F, 18C and 6B) conjugated to CRM197 (PCV7CRM197), a nontoxic variant of the diphtheria toxin. It was shown to be efficacious for IPD, pneumococcal pneumonia and AOM in several randomized trials (Black et al. 2000; Black et al. 2002; Eskola et al. 2001; Fireman et al. 2003; O’Brien et al. 2003; O’Brien et al. 2008). In the 2000s, higher valency conjugated vaccines were developed and received licensure, based on the randomized trials conducted for the heptavalent conjugated vaccine. They have however been shown to be effective in several cluster randomized trials and observational studies. 2.2.2 Key concepts in pneumococcal vaccine epidemiology The epidemiology of pneumococcus is complicated by its relationship with humans. It is both a component of the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract and a common pathogen. Because of the polysaccharide coat, protection against one serotype does not necessarily confer protection against another. If one serotype disappears due to immune recognition, an ecological niche is created which can be filled by different serotype. This process takes place on both the individual and community level. Systematic vaccination programs greatly reduce the prevalence of carriage and disease of the serotypes contained within the vaccine among the vaccinated. If the vaccinated individuals compromise a large enough portion of the population. 2.2.3 The impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on otitis media Acute otitis media is still most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae despite changes in otopathogens. Prevention of IPD in children and the associated morbidity and mortality was the driving force in the development of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. However, the public most often associates them with AOM. Most children experience AOM and the dramatic decrease in incidence following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is what families noticed. Despite this, AOM is a difficult outcome for trialist as it exists on a continuum. It does not have universally adhered to diagnostic criteria and its signs and symptoms greatly overlap with those of other common diseases. Because AOM is benign and most often self-limited, the probability that a child with AOM is even seen by a physician varies greatly with parental health seeking behavior. Even when AOM is accurately diagnosed it is not possible to ascertain the causative pathogen without invasive sampling, which is not warranted given the benign nature of the disease. This precludes measuring the serotype specific effect of vaccination for most studies - and more importantly, it precludes measuring the effect on pneumococcal AOM. Thus any estimation of an effect of pneumococcal vaccination will necessarily by diluted by the subjectiveness of AOM diagnosis and the continued lack of protection against other otopathogens. Despite these difficulties, AOM has been associated with pneumococcal vaccination in children from the beginning. It was used as an outcome measure in the earliest trials of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (Mäkelä et al. 1981; Sloyer, Ploussard, and Howie 1981). In the following sub-chapters, the evidence regarding the efficacy and impact of PCV on the otitis media will be reviewed. Randomized controlled trials will be reviewed in greater depth, as they represented the highest quality of evidence of true efficacy. Observational studies will be reviewed more generally. 2.2.3.1 Randomized controlled trials The first published randomized controlled trial of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reported, among other outcomes, the efficacy against AOM (Black et al. 2000). The study recruited 37,868 children between October 1995 and August 1998 and randomized them to the either PCV7CRM197 or the meningococcus C CRM197 conjugate vaccine. A separate publication from the same trial was published in 2003, and examined the effect of PCV7CRM197 on AOM in more detail using the full data until study completion in April 1999 (Fireman et al. 2003). A visit was considered to be due to the same episode of AOM if the child presented within 21 days of a previous AOM associated visit. Frequent otitis media was then defined as either three episodes within a six month period, or four episodes within a twelve month period. Both the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox proportional hazards model with robust variance estimation and the binomial test with Klopper-Pearson confidence intervals were used and efficacy was reported as \\((1 - ratio\\ measure) *100\\%\\). The estimated vaccine efficacy against otitis media visits was 7.8% (95%CI 5.4%-10.2%). Slightly higher point estimates were found for otitis media episodes, frequent otitis media and ventilatory tube placements (Black et al. 2000; Fireman et al. 2003) The following year the results of two more randomized controlled trials were published (Dagan et al. 2001; Eskola et al. 2001). Dagan et al. (2001) enrolled 264 children ages 12-35 months of age attending eight daycare centers in Beer-Sheva, Isreal. The study employed a block randomized design which stratified the children according to daycare center and age-group. Within each stratified group, children were randomized in blocks of six. The study examined a nine valent pneumococcal CRM197 conjugate vaccine produced by Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and used the same meningococcal C CRM197 conjugate vaccine as the Black et al. (2000) study as a control. The study’s primary endpoint was vaccine-type nasopharyngeal carriage and the secondary endpoint was parent reported respiratory infections. Monthly questionnaires were submitted to parents for one year starting one month after the last per-protocol vaccine dose, and bimonthly thereafter for a total of 18 encounters. Respiratory infections were split into four different categories (Upper respiratory infections, lower respiratory problems, otitis media and other illnesses) and the results were measured in two different ways; episodes per 100 child-months and the proportion of antimicrobial days during the study period. Finally, each category and measurement was compared in children &lt;36 months of age, 36 months of age and older, and overall, resulting in \\(4\\ *\\ 2\\ *\\ 3=16\\) comparisons between the intervention and control. The statistical analysis used \\(\\chi^2\\) and Fischer’s exact contingency table methods but did not account for multiple testing. The study reported an efficacy of 17% (95%CI -2%-33%) for otitis media episodes and 20% (95%CI 14%-26%) antimicrobial treated otitis media, as measured by days spent on antimicrobial. The later does remain statistically significant when the result has been corrected for multiple testing using any standard method. The later study published in 2001 compared two heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines to a hepatitis B vaccine control (Eskola et al. 2001). The two heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines differed in their use of carrier protein. One was the same vaccine as in the Black et al. (2000) study (PCV7CRM197), and the other was a conjugated to meningococcal outer membrane protein complex (PCV7MOMPC). The Eskola et al. (2001) paper reported comparison of the PCV7CRM197 to the hepatitis B vaccine. The analogous comparison of the PCV7MOMPC was reported in a separate publication (Kilpi et al. 2003). No head-to-head comparison of the two heptavalent vaccines was ever reported. The study methodology was identical between the two publications as they report different arms of the same study (Eskola et al. 2001; Kilpi et al. 2003). The study was specifically designed to address the difficulties associated with estimating the effect of pneumococcal vaccination on AOM. A total of 2,497 children were enrolled between December 1995 and April 1997, of which 835 received the PCV7MOMPC vaccine and were therefore not reported in the Eskola et al. (2001) paper. Children were followed until their last visit at 24 months of age. Of the enrolled children, 95.1% completed full follow-up time and there was no evidence of differential dropout. The study defined beforehand the criteria for what constituted AOM and employed a trained study nurse and physician at each study site. Children were seen at enrollment at two months of age, and periodically assessed thereafter at four, six, seven, twelve, thirteen and 24 months of age. If AOM was diagnosed as defined by the study criteria, myringotomy and aspiration of middle-ear fluid were performed and samples sent for culture. In this way, the study was able to deduce the causative otopathogen. Episodes of AOM were classified as all-cause AOM; culture-confirmed and otopathogen specific AOM; and AOM due to serotypes included in the vaccine. The statistical analysis was again conducted using the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox proportional hazards model with robust variance estimates and efficacy was reported as \\((1 - hazard\\ ratio) *100\\%\\). The results were most consistent with a 6% efficacy against all-cause AOM with 95% confidence limits of -4% and 16%. In this case the negative lower confidence limit indicates the data could be consistent with the possibility of a 4% increase in all-cause AOM, given the specified model. The PCVCRM197 efficacy against culture-confirmed pneumococcal AOM was 35% (95%CI 21%-45%) and was 57% (95%CI 44%-67%) for the seven serotypes included in the vaccine. Similarly, the study demonstrated 57% (95%CI 27%-76%) efficacy against AOM caused by serotype 6A, which is considered a cross-reactive pneumococcal serotype. The study was also one of the first to demonstrate clinically relevant serotype replacement, showing a 33% (95%CI -1%-80%) increase in pneumococcal AOM caused by serotypes not included in the vaccine. Children who completed the Eskola et al. (2001) trial and were still living in the study area were invited for a follow-up interview when they were four to five years of age (Palmu et al. 2004). In the extended follow-up trial, the vaccine effectiveness against all tympanostomy tube placements was estimated to be 39% (95%CI 4%-61%). However, this was unblinded study following the unmasking of the original study and there was differential recruitment between the placebo and PCV7CRM197 arms. There was therefore a substantial risk of bias in the study. The effect estimates for the PCV7MOMPC against culture-confirmed pneumococcal AOM was 25% (95%CI 11%-37%) and was 56% (95%CI 44%-66%) for the seven serotypes included in the vaccine (Kilpi et al. 2003). However, unlike PCVCRM197, it did not seem to confer protection against cross-reactive serotypes. Interestingly, virtually no effect was seen on all-cause AOM with this vaccine preparation. The effect estimate was -1% (95%CI -12%-10%). These surprising results were not presented in the main text and no explanation was given in the discussion chapter of the paper. In 2006, Prymula et al. (2006) reported a randomized study of an eleven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 4,968 children recruited from paediatric centers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (Prymula et al. 2006). A strict case definition of otitis media was used and all cases were reviewed by an otolaryngologist. If confirmed, a middle ear fluid sample was obtained by aspiration and sent for culturing. Statistical analysis was completed using Cox proportional hazards models and the Anderson-Gill extension for repeated events. In 2003, the first paper from a cluster randomized controlled trial of PCV7CRM197 among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache infants was published (O’Brien et al. 2003). In 2008, a retrospective chart review of AOM visits among the participating children was published (O’Brien et al. 2008). The study population was defined as children who had adhered to the study protocol, i.e. a per-protocol analysis. From this population, 944 of the 4,476 eligible children were randomly sampled for chart review. The sample size was restricted for logistical reasons. A rough power analysis which assumed 1.5 years of follow-up time per chart and a baseline incidence of one AOM visit per person-year suggested that a sample of 1,000 children would give 80% power to detect a 15% reduction in the incidence of AOM visits. It is unclear why only 944 children were sampled, given that the power calculation assumed 1,000. Furthermore, it should be noted that the investigators performing the chart review were not blinded to vaccine allocation. This becomes significant when considering that the reviewers had significant leeway in deciding what constituted an AOM visit, and how to categorize the multitude of subjective subgroups considered in the study. Of the 944 children reviewed, only 803 were included for various reasons further limiting the study’s sample. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio between the study arms, and sandwich variance estimates were used to account for the block-randomized design. No difference was found between the PCV7CRM197 arm and the control, with an estimated vaccine efficacy of -0.4% (95%CI -19.4%-15.6%). It is debatable whether this should be considered a randomized controlled trial in light of the methodological flaws discussed above. Even if the study were to be considered randomized, it is unclear how to interpret a study that does not even have 80% power to detect a difference twice as large as the the estimates presented by previous randomized controlled trials.

(2013) 2.3 Cost-effectiveness in the context of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (#cea-introduction) Healthcare operates under resource constraints. In this setting of scarcity, the decision to fund one project invariably results in another project remaining unfunded. Economic analyses are one of many tools that may aid decision-makers in allocating resources optimally. Interventions are contrasted with two or more alternatives, and costs and benefits are systematically compared. Economic analyses require data on the efficacy of the interventions being compared, the burden of disease and subgroups of the population which are affected (Gray et al. 2011). All methods of economic analyses measure the monetary costs associated with the interventions being evaluated, but differ in how they measure the resultant benefits. Cost-benefit analysis translates the effect of an intervention into a monetary value, and calculates the total cost associated with the intervention once any potential savings have been accounted. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the effect of the intervention is measured in units of the condition being intervened upon, e.g. deaths prevented, life-years gained. The results of such an analysis are commonly presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which represents the cost associated with one unit change in the effect measure. Cost-effectiveness analyses are preferred over cost-benefit analyses in the healthcare context, as placing a monetary value on a health-effect is both controversial and impractical. One drawback however, is difficulty in comparing cost-effectiveness ratios between studies that use different measurements of effect. Cost-utility analyses remedy this by standardizing a combined effect that measures the quality and quantity of life gained. This combined effect is most often measured in units of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) (Gray et al. 2011). Quality-adjusted life-years are constructed by dividing each persons life into units of time. A unit of time lived in perfect health is assigned a value of one, while death is assigned a value of zero. Each disease is assigned a utility, which represents the health-related quality of life an individual is expected to have while suffering from the disease. Three methods are generally used to obtain utility values for a given health state. These are the rating scale method, time trade-off and standard gamble. Each method is intended to capture the preferences of the population in which the economic analysis is meant to inform, and they are not meant to be generalized to other populations except with extreme caution (Petrou and Kupek 2009). Even then, some external criteria must be used for the results to be interpretable. Decision-makers must specify the threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, below which an intervention is deemed cost-effective. Measuring costs associated with an intervention is deceptively simple. The costs associated with an intervention depend on from what perspective the intervention is evaluated (Byford and Raftery 1998). When examined from the societal perspective, an expensive medication may be cost-saving, if it allows individuals who would have otherwise required disability benefits to participate in the workforce . The same medication may be considered prohibitively costly when examined from the healthcare sector perspective. The choice of perspective should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the intended audience. For the health-economic analysis of vaccines, the general consensus is to choose the societal perspective but also include an analysis from the perspective of the healthcare sector (Sanders et al. 2016). Interventions are compared at a single point in time but accrue costs and benefits over a variably long time period. The time horizon is the term used for the time period over which an intervention is evaluated. In general, the time horizon should be chosen to reflect the duration of the effect of the intervention. In the context of cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccines, the consensus is to use a lifetime horizon, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise (Mauskopf et al. 2018; Wilkinson et al. 2016). To accurately compare interventions with differential distributions in the timing of costs and benefits, it has become standard practice to discount future cost and benefit. The rationale is grounded in both the psychology of human behavior and economic principles (Severens and Milne 2004). Society tends to value current costs and benefits higher than those that occur in the future. The exact discount rate, whether it should be constant and whether costs and benefits should be discounted at the same rate are debated (Claxton et al. 2011). However, the general consensus is to use a constant 3% discount rate for both costs and benefits (Mauskopf et al. 2018; Sanders et al. 2016; Wilkinson et al. 2016). Economic analyses are built upon a set of assumptions that may influence the outcome. In the case of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the assumptions include the incidence of disease in the target population, the proportion caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the serotype distribution, the degree of vaccine uptake, the vaccine efficacy in vaccinated and unvaccinated members of the population, costs and utilities associated with disease states, cost of the vaccine, perspective, time horizon and discounting (Wasserman et al. 2018). These assumptions are combined together in mathematical model which describes the result, given the input parameters. Decision analysis models are static scenario based models in which individuals are independently assumed to progress through a decision tree. The tree has one branch for each intervention being evaluated, and each branch contains an identical set of nodes that represent the health outcomes being considered. However, the nodes on each branch are associated with a different set of costs, consequences and probabilities of occurring, The model is run and the number of individuals in each node are tallied along with the associated cost and consequence to produce the final result. This generally means that the model cannot incorporate different probabilities depending on age or time from the start of the intervention (Gray et al. 2011). For example, a decision analysis model would assume that the difference in invasive pneumococcal disease with and without the vaccine were constant, regardless of how many years had passed since the vaccine introduction. Markov models expand upon this framework, by removing the tree structure and allowing individuals to transition between nodes (which are termed health states in Markov models) in any direction. The transitions between health states occur in Markov cycles. At the end of each cycle, the costs and consequences associated with the current health state are recorded, before the next cycle begins. Thus an individual accumulates cost and benefit over time and may transition in and out of health states – an improvement over the static once-only decision analysis models. The transition probabilities may be either constant or time-dependent. However, the Markovian assumption requires that all individuals within a given health state should be homogenous, regardless of their previous health states or the length of time that they have been in their current state. Thus the transition between health states may depend on the time that has elapsed from the start of the model but cannot depend on what has happened in a prior cycle (Gray et al. 2011). A Markov model would assume that an individual who has previously been hospitalized twice for pneumonia, has the same probability of being hospitalized again as someone who has never been hospitalized. Transmission dynamic models expand upon the Markov process by using a set of differential equations to remove the need for the Markovian assumption (Pitman et al. 2012). Because of the subjective nature of many of the modeling assumptions, a sensitivity analysis that explores the cost-effectiveness outcome over a plausible range of each of the assumptions is necessary. Consensus statements from the World Health Organization and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research (ISPOR) require at minimum, a one-way sensitivity analysis of each of the assumptions (Mauskopf et al. 2018; Walker, Hutubessy, and Beutels 2010). One-way sensitivity analysis imply that each parameter is individually varied across its probability distribution, while other parameters are held constant. The results are often presented as a tornado plot. Scenario analyses show the result of specific combinations of parameter values, which are often based on common situations that Both consensus statements strongly recommend the inclusion of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which the analysis is repeatedly run and the assumptions simultaneously varied across their respective probability distributions (Gray et al. 2011). The resulting spread of cost-effectiveness estimates reflects the uncertainty of the analysis. This can be paired with threshold analysis, which shows the proportion of the resulting spread that is above a stated cost-effectiveness threshold, or a generalization of a threshold analysis called the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) (Gray et al. 2011). A large number of cost-effectiveness analyses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been published (Saokaew et al. 2016; Vooren et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2015). They display great variation in their results, underlying assumptions and modeling choices. In this thesis, cost-effectiveness analyses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in high-income countries will be reviewed. The studies included in this review are summarized in Table 2.3. This review focuses on studies published in 2009 and later, after the introduction of the higher-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Other published reviews have examined cost-effectiveness studies prior to 2006 (Beutels, Thiry, and Van Damme 2007) and studies in low- and middle income countries (Saokaew et al. 2016). All of the included studies found pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to be cost-effective compared to no vaccine, but varied as to whether PCV7, PCV10 or PCV13 dominated as compared to the others. The aim of this review is to explore the studies’ design and underlying assumptions, rather than the results. Table 2.3: A summary of the economic analyses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in high-income countries from 2009-2018. All analyses are either a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) or cost-utility analysis (CUA). Costs and benefit are either considered from the societal or health sector perspective, depending on whether indirect costs such as productivity loss are included in the analyses, The time horizon of the studies er presented in years. A lifetime horizon is based on the life-expectancy of the population, and is most commonly assumed to be 100 years. Discount rates are presented separately for costs and benefits. When the time horizon is one year or less, discount rates are not applicable and are presented with a hyphen (-). Earnshaw et al. (2012) did not publish sufficent information to know what discount rate was used. The table is partially adapted from Wu et al. (2015).

Most, but not all, include acute otitis media, pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease. The way in which each study measures these health outcomes differs, and the studies assume divergent vaccine efficacies for outcomes. Each of the health outcomes considered may or may not be associated with further health care consumption and disease burden. Repeated acute otitis media may lead to a tympanostomy tube procedure, and invasive pneumococcal disease may cause death or long term disability. If and how disease sequlae are taken into account is variable between studies. Finally, the studies differ in whether they consider health outcomes in unvaccinated members of the population (Holubar et al. 2017; Isaacman et al. 2008). Most of the cost-effectiveness analyses that were reviewed based their vaccine efficacy estimates for acute otitis media on the results of the Northern California Kaiser Permente trial (Black et al. 2000; Fireman et al. 2003). Others, (Castiglia et al. 2017; Delgleize et al. 2016; Klok et al. 2013; Knerer, Ismaila, and Pearce 2012; Robberstad et al. 2011; Strutton et al. 2012; Talbird et al. 2010) based the efficacy of PCV7 and PCV13 on Eskola et al. (2001), and justified a higher vaccine efficacy estimate for PHiD-CV10 based on Prymula et al. (2006) or Tregnaghi et al. (2014), by also assuming efficacy against otitis media caused by non-typable Haemophilus influenzae. The validity of this assumption has been called into question (Wasserman et al. 2018). Few studies did not base their efficacy estimates on data from randomized clinical trials. Gouveia et al. (2017) based their otitis media efficacy estimates on observational data from the United Kingdom, which used a crude interrupted time series analysis to ascertain impact (Lau et al. 2015). Hoek et al. (2012) assumed the otitis media efficacy to be a linear ratio of their estimated efficacy for invasive pneumococcal disease, which they based on a complex transmission dynamic model. Chuck et al. (2010) also based the efficacy for otitis media on invasive pneumococcal disease, but used the observed change in invasive disease before and after vaccine introduction without any adjustments for secular trends in the pre-vaccine period. Similarly, Zhou et al. (2014) did not use any efficacy estimates, but instead directly compared published incidence rates of otitis media before and after vaccine introduction and assumed any difference was due to the vaccine. The vaccine efficacy estimates for hospitalized and non-hospitalized pneumonia were generally based on Black and Shinefield (2002). As with otitis media, Delgleize et al. (2016) and Castiglia et al. (2017) based their estimates on Tregnaghi et al. (2014). Newall et al. (2016) based the efficacy against outpatient pneumonia on Black and Shinefield (2002), as did other studies. However, the efficacy estimates for inpatient pneumonia and invasive disease was estimated using a novel time-series methodology. They projected the rate of disease in the pre-vaccine period to the post-vaccine period using a Poisson regression, and corrected for changes in population demographics using an offset term. Because they only had access to three years of annual pre-vaccine incidence rates, they were unfortunately only able to correct for an intercept term and they acknowledge this in their discussion section (Newall et al. 2016). Nevertheless, the methodology is interesting. In the case of pneumonia, a larger proportion of studies based their estimates on either unadjusted observational studies from other populations or did not provide sufficient information to ascertain what estimates was used. Chuck et al. (2010) and Hoek et al. (2012) again assumed the efficacy for pneumonia to be a fixed ratio of their invasive pneumococcal disease efficacy estimate. Talbird et al. (2010) and Gouveia et al. (2017) never explicitly state what their assumed vaccine efficacy is, and no rationale is provided. The estimate cannot be deduced from tables and references. Díez-Domingo et al. (2011) assumed a 42% efficacy against hospitalized pneumonia cases but did not provide any rationale or reference for this assumption. Zhou et al. (2014) directly compared published incidence rates for pneumonia in the pre- and post-vaccine periods, and assumed any difference to be a direct result of vaccination. Finally, O’Brien et al. (2009) did not consider pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease as health outcomes. Invasive pneumococcal disease vaccine efficacy estimates were most often based on Black et al. (2000), and Kuhlmann and Schulenburg (2017) based their estimate on Palmu et al. (2013). Newall et al. (2016) used a novel regression methodology as previously described, and Chuck et al. (2010) used simple unadjusted pre- and post-vaccine observational data. The remaining studies based their efficacy estimates on non-randomized studies observational studies in different populations. Hoek et al. (2012) utilized a complex transmission dynamic model on meticulously collected prospective surveillance data to estimate the effect of PCV13, but did not provide any reference or rationale for the efficacy parameters used in the model. Castiglia et al. (2017) assumed that the vaccine efficacy of PCV10 and PCV13 were the average of two observational studies (Palmu et al. 2015; Waight et al. 2015). By et al. (2012), Delgleize et al. (2016), Knerer, Ismaila, and Pearce (2012), Newall et al. (2011) and Robberstad et al. (2011) based their efficacy estimate on a matched case-control study of PCV7, conducted in the United States in 2001-2002 (Whitney et al. 2006). Talbird et al. (2010) failed to provide any reference or rationale for their efficacy estimates. The included cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses base their efficacy estimates on many different studies. Critical appraisals of underlying assumptions have shown that they can have large effects on the study’s outcomes (Wasserman et al. 2018). An alarmingly large proportion of studies cite observational data from other time-periods and study populations that used a different formulation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In most cases were randomized controlled trials are utilized, the most commonly referenced studies were conducted ten years prior in a completely vaccine naive population using PCV7. Newall et al. (2016) introduced a thoughtful time-series approach were local pre-vaccine trends in disease were statistically extrapolated to the post-vaccine period to simulate what would have occurred, had the vaccine not been introduced. This was ten subtracted from the observed rates of disease to estimate the true vaccine impact. However, as the authors concede in their discussion, they did not have access to adequate pre-vaccine data and were thus unable to conduct a robust statistical extrapolation (Newall et al. 2016). The care with which these data are incorporated also varies between studies, with only some considering vaccine coverage, waning vaccine protection and adjusting for local serotype distribution and herd effect 2.4. Additionally, a large variation existed in how the pre-vaccine incidence of disease was defined, with some studies borrowing incidence estimates from other countries. A review of the epidemiological rationale used in each of the studies is beyond the scope of this thesis. Table 2.4: A summary of modeling assumptions used in economic analyses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in high-income countries from 2009-2018. Several different modeling strategies were used, which are discussed in more detail in chapter ??.. Vaccine protection is known to wane over an unknown length of time. The assumed length of protection is presented with a hyphen (-) if the study assumed infinite protection or did not provide sufficient data to ascertain over which period the protection waned. Similarly, a hyphen indicates that assumed vaccine coverage was not specified. When herd effect was included in the model, it was often only included for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Serotype replacement was often only incorporated for indirect effects (herd immunity, herd effect). When models are based on ecological data, they implicitly includ both herd effects and serotype replacement. Only Hoek et al. (2012) directly modelled the serotype replacement. Sensitivity analyses are can be either deterministic, such as 1-Way, 2-Way and scenario analyses, or stochastic, such as proabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC). Sensitivity analyses are discussed in more detail in chapter ??.. The table is partially adapted from Wu et al. (2015).

QALYs are a good universal measure of benefit, assuming the quality adjustment for given health outcomes accurately reflects the true preferences of the population for which the cost-utility analysis is supposed to inform decision making. Otherwise the cost-utility ratio is at best externally valid in comparison to other studies using the same incorrect weights, but has no intrinsic meaning in informing decision-makers. To date, only three studies have been published that estimate utility values for pneumococcal diseases in high-income countries by interviewing children or parents of children who have experienced the disease. One study in the United States in 2001 used time trade-off and willingness-to-pay methods to estimate the utility values associated with simple and complex acute otitis media, moderate and severe pneumonia, meningitis and bacteremia (Prosser et al. 2004). Another study from the United Kingdom used the health utility index to estimate utility values for pneumococcal meningitis (Legood et al. 2009). It is unclear from the publication over which time period the study was conducted. Finally, the utility values for adult pneumococcal pneumonia were estimated using the EuroQoL five dimensional questionarie in France (Andrade et al. 2018). Additionally, Bennett et al. (2000) estimated utility values for meningitis sequlae; deafness and moderate and severe brain damage by interviewing parents of toddlers presenting to urgent care for unrelated illnesses. Oostenbrink, A Moll, and Essink-Bot (2002) surveyed 28 pediatricians in the Netherlands using the health utility index and EuroQoL five dimensional questionnaires to ascertain utility weights for long term sequlae of bacterial meningitis. With few exceptions, all of the reviewed cost-utility analyses referenced Bennett et al. (2000) and Oostenbrink, A Moll, and Essink-Bot (2002; Herdman et al. 2016). Most did so indirectly, and instead cited a cost-utility analysis by Melegaro and Edmunds (2004), which itself based it’s estimates on the two studies. These included Kuhlmann and Schulenburg (2017). Newall et al. (2011), Newall et al. (2016), Rozenbaum et al. (2010), Rubin et al. (2010) and Talbird et al. (2010). This is important as Melegaro and Edmunds (2004) incorrectly translated the utility values to QALYs (Herdman et al. 2016). Earnshaw et al. (2012) and Knerer, Ismaila, and Pearce (2012) take the extra step of citing Morrow et al. (2007), which itself cites Melegaro and Edmunds (2004) and By et al. (2012) cites both Morrow et al. (2007) and Melegaro and Edmunds (2004). O’Brien et al. (2009) base their utility values on Prosser et al. (2004). Klok et al. (2013) uses utilities based on a Maddigan, Feeny, and Johnson (2005) which is a study of the quality of life of diabetic adults in Canada, and provides no rationale for the how this could be relevant to pneumococcal disease in Danish and Swedish children. Strutton et al. (2012) claim to use country specific utilities for Germany, Greece and the Netherlands, but provide no reference for the utility values, which are the same for each country and identical to those in Maddigan, Feeny, and Johnson (2005). Chuck et al. (2010) references the Canadian National advisory committee on immunization statement on recommended use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which is not available online.

All data was identifiable to individuals by government issued national identification numbers. Each individual receives only one number over the course of their lifetime, and the identification number is permanently retired at the time of death. The Icelandic Directorate of Health processed and anonymized all data from the various registries before releasing it to the study group. A study identifier was created based on the national identification number, which was then removed from the data as part of the anonymization process. The mapping key is kept by the Directorate of Health, and is not accessible to the study group. The study group linked the data from the various registries using both the study identifier and dates of events. The data underlying this study is observational in nature, and its quality is enhanced by several factors. Not only are all medical records in Iceland stored electronically, but the same software, Saga, was used by all health care providers and institutions throughout the study period. Likewise, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), is the only diagnostic coding system in use in Iceland during the study period. Furthermore, all medical procedures have been coded with the NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP), and drugs classified using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) classification system of the World Health Organization. Continuity between data systems enhanced the quality of results. In the following sub-chapters, each registry providing study data is reviewed. Statistics Iceland provided data on immigration and emigration, demographic indices and salaries. Diagnostic data was obtained from Landspitali University Hospital’s patient registry and the Primary Care Registry of the Directorate of Health. Pneumococcal vaccination status was collected from the National Vaccine Registry (NVR) and augmented with information on privately purchased vaccine doses obtained from the National Drug Prescription Registry (NDPR). Data regarding antimicrobial prescriptions was also extracted from the NDPR. Finally, reimbursement data for outpatient otolaryngological procedures was obtained from Icelandic Health Insurance. 4.1.1 Statistics Iceland Statistics Iceland collects and maintains a large array of economical, social and demographic indices, and provides aggregate data at www.statice.is. For each calendar-year 2005-2017, the number of individuals living in Iceland was collected from Statistics Iceland, stratified by postal-code, gender and age in years. This data was used for the denominator in incidence calculations in all papers. The deciles of salary from 2005-2017 were obtained from Statistics Iceland and used to inform a sensitivity analysis on the cost-benefit of PHiD-CV10 ( Paper VI). Costs were adjusted for inflation using the National Wage Index of Statistics Iceland. In addition to the aggregate data presented above, individual level information on the immigration and emigration of children zero to four years of age was obtained, anonymized and linked to the other study data. 4.1.2 Landspitali University Hospital patient registry Landspitali University Hospital is the sole tertiary hospital in Iceland, and includes Children’s Hospital Iceland – Iceland’s only pediatric hospital. It provides primary and secondary care for the capital area, approximately 65% of the Icelandic population, and tertiary care for the whole population. In 2017, the total number of non-psychiatric curative care hospital beds in Iceland was 732 (www.statice.is). Of those, 669 (91%) were at Landspitali University Hospital. Landspitali’s patient registry records information on all emergency department and outpatient visits, and all hospital admissions to Landspitali University Hospital. For the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017, data was extracted on all unplanned acute-care visits and hospital admissions with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses compatible with respiratory infections (see Table 4.1). Table 4.1: The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes used in the current study ICD-10 code Disease A40 Streptococcal sepsis A41 Other sepsis A48 Other bacterial diseases, not elsewhere classified A49 Bacterial infection of unspecified site B00 Herpesviral [herpes simplex] infections B08 Other viral infections characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions, not elsewhere classified B33 Other viral diseases, not elsewhere classified B34 Viral infection of unspecified site B95 Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere B96 Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere G00 Bacterial meningitis,not elsewhere classified H65 Nonsuppurative otitis media H66 Suppurative and unspecified otitis media H70 Mastoiditis and related conditions H72 Perforation of tympanic membrane H73 Other disorders of tympanic membrane J00 Acute nasopharyngitis [common cold] J01 Acute sinusitis J02 Acute pharyngitis J03 Acute tonsillitis J04 Acute laryngitis and tracheitis J05 Acute obstructive laryngitis [croup] and epiglottitis J06 Acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites J09 Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses J10 Influenza due to other identified influenza virus J11 Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus J12 Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified J13 Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae J14 Pneumonia due to Hemophilus influenzae J15 Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified J16 Pneumonia due to other infectious organisms, not elsewhere classified J17 Pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere J18 Pneumonia, unspecified organism J20 Acute bronchitis J21 Acute bronchiolitis J22 Unspecified acute lower respiratory infection J32 Chronic sinusitis J36 Peritonsillar abscess J40 Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic J85 Abscess of lung and mediastinum J86 Pyothorax J90 Pleural effusion, not elsewhere classified N30 Cystitis N39 Other disorders of urinary system R05 Cough R50 Fever of other and unknown origin Additionally, any visit or hospital admission associated with NCSP procedural codes in Table 4.2 were extracted the patient registry.

A separate and unique identification number was provided for each individual visit or hospital admission. Several smaller independent data-sets pertaining to specific papers were extracted from the patient registry. These data-sets were not linked to the main study data. In paper I, describing the impact of PHiD-CV10 on otitis media with treatment failure, information about all doses of ceftriaxone administered at the Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 2009 and December 2015 was extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. Any ICD-10 diagnostic code associated with a visit or hospital admission in which ceftriaxone was administered, was extracted from the patient registry. Importantly, this included all ICD-10 codes, not only those in Table 4.1. Also obtained for paper I was the aggregate number of yearly visits to the pediatric emergency department of Children’s Hospital Iceland 2008-2015. Paper VI – a cost-benefit analysis of PHiD-CV10 introduction into the pediatric vaccination program, required synthetic controls used within a time-series analysis framework. The aggregate monthly number of acute-care visits and hospital admissions for several sub-chapters of the ICD-10 diagnostic coding system (Table 4.3) were obtained for 22 different age-groups. Table 4.3: The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision subchapters used to define synthetic conrtrols ICD-10 code Description A10-B99 Certain infectious and parasitic diseases C00-D48 Neoplasms D50-89 Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism E00-99 Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases G00-G99 Diseases of the nervous system H00-99 Diseases of the eye and adnexa, Diseases of the ear and mastoid process I00-99 Diseases of the circulatory system K00-99 Diseases of the digestive system L00-99 Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue M00-99 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue N00-99 Diseases of the genitourinary system P00-99 Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period Q00-99 Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities R00-99 Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified S00-T99 Provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology U00-99 Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes V00-Y99 External causes of morbidity Z00-99 Factors influencing health status and contact with health services Data from the patient registry was used in paper I, paper IV, paper V and paper VI. 4.1.3 The Primary Care Registry In the Icelandic healthcare system, primary care is provided by family medicine physicians at 69 neighborhood based centers (Heilsugæsla). All primary care centers use the same electronic medical record system, and the same diagnostic coding systems (NCSP, ICD-10) as Landspitali University Hospital and Children’s Hospital Iceland. The Directorate of Health maintains a registry on all primary care visits within the Icelandic healthcare system. From this registry, all physician visits with ICD-10 diagnostic codes compatible with respiratory tract infections were extracted for the period January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2015 (Table 4.1). From early 2016, extensive maintenance and restructuring of the registry has been ongoing, and no new data has been added since December 31, 2015. Data from the Primary Care Registry was used in paper II, paper III, paper IV and paper VI. 4.1.4 The National Vaccine Registry The Icelandic Directorate of Health also maintains the National Vaccine Registry (NVR). All vaccine doses administered within the healthcare system are systematically recorded in an individual’s electronic health record at the time they are administered. This record is reviewed and updated regularly, and vaccinations given in other healthcare facilities are included. The NVR collects this information from all electronic health records in the country. All administered vaccine doses with ATC codes “J07AL” (Pneumococcal vaccines) were extracted for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017. Data from the NVR are used in all papers. 4.1.5 The National Drug Prescription Registry The national drug prescription registry (NDPR) is a whole-population registry, collected and maintained by the Icelandic Directorate of Health since January 1, 2005. It contains information on all filled drug prescriptions in Iceland. All pharmacies are required by law to collect data on each filled prescription and submit them to the NDPR. An important distinction must be made between a written prescription and a filled prescription. The NDPR receives information if and when a prescription is filled. It does not record information on written prescriptions that were never filled by the patient. Therefore, all prescriptions documented within the NDPR were paid for and received by the patient. Extensive validation and error testing have been performed by the Directorate of Health to ensure the robustness of the NDPR. Automated electronic submissions, coupled with tightly controlled processes by which pharmacies dispense drugs, has essentially excluded the possibility of any filled prescriptions escaping registration. All prescriptions within the ATC therapeutic subgroup “J01” (Antibacterials for Systemic Use), “J07” (Vaccines), “S01” (Opthalmologicals) and “S02” (Otologicals) were extracted for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017. The chemical subgroups used in the study are shown in Table 4.4 Table 4.4: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes used in the current study ATC chemical subgroup code Description J01A Tetracyclines J01B Amphenicols J01C Beta-lactam antibacterials, penicillins J01D Other beta-lactam antibacterials J01E Sulfonamides and trimethoprim J01F Macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins J01G Aminoglycoside antibacterials J01M Quinolone antibacterials J01R Combinations of antibacterials J01X Other antibacterials J07A Bacterial vaccines J07B Viral vaccines J07C Bacterial and viral vaccines J07X Other vaccines S01A, S02A Anti-infectives S01C, S02C Anti-inflammatory agents and anti-infectives in combination Data from the NDPR was used in paper II, paper III and paper IV. 4.1.6 Reimbursement database of Icelandic Health Insurance The healthcare system in Iceland is a single-payer system with one government-run health insurance provider, under which all permanent citizens are covered. Most healthcare visits require a nominal out-of-pocket fee, with the rest of the visit covered by the insurance. There are exceptions to this – for example, visits by children under two years of age are completely covered by the insurance. Healthcare providers are either salaried governmental employees, or independent practitioners who are reimbursed on a per case basis, according to pre-determined negotiations with Icelandic Health Insurance. To receive pay for services, physicians must submit a reimbursement form, detailing the nature of the visit and any procedures performed using pre-specified procedural codes. Icelandic Health Insurance maintains a reimbursement database which details the nature and number of procedures performed. Data on all otolaryngological procedures performed on the middle ear and tonsils were extracted from the reimbursement database for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017 using the procedural codes in Table 4.5 Table 4.5: Reimbursement codes used in the current study Reimbursement code Description 5500601 Myringotomy, one or both ears, under local anesthetic 5500602/55Q0602+55Z0602 Placement of tympanostomy, one ear (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5500603/55Q0603+55Z0603 Placement of tympanostomy tube, one ear, and myringotomy, both ears (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5500604/55Q0604+55Z0604 Removal of tympanostomy tube, one ear (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501001/55Q1001+55Z1001 Placement of tympanostomy tube, both ears (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501002/55Q1002+55Z1002 Removal of tympanostomy tube, both ears (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501201/55Q1201+55Z1201 Adenoidectomy (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501301/55Q1301+55Z1301 Adenoidectomy and placement of tymponstomy tube or myringotomy, one or both ears (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501801/55Q1801+55Z1801 Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501802/55Q1802+55Z1802 Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy - performed with laser (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501901/55Q1901+55Z1901 Tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, and tympanostomy or myringotomy (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5501902/55Q1902+55Z1902 Tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, and tympanostomy or myringotomy - performed with laser (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) 5502002/55Q2002+55Z2002 Myringoplasty with patch (local anesthetic/general anesthesia) Data from the reimbursement database was used in paper IV. 4.2 Impact on otitis media with treatment failure (Paper I) The objective of Paper I was to evaluate whether the introduction of PHiD-CV10 was associated with a reduction in the incidence of otitis media with treatment failure. Treatment of otitis media with ceftriaxone was used as a proxy for treatment failure. Ceftriaxone use for other diagnoses and in older children was used as a comparator. All children under eighteen years of age who visited Children’s Hospital Iceland between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015 were included. Children’s Hospital Iceland’s referral area was defined as a 100km driving distance from the hospital. Population demographic data for the referral area was obtained from Statistics Iceland (www.statice.is), as previously described in 4.1.1. Data was extracted from Landspitali University Hospital’s patient registry. A visit was included in the study if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) was documented in the medical record, or if a child received one or more doses of ceftriaxone. All administered doses of ceftriaxone were systematically extracted from the hospital’s medication administration system using the ATC code J01DD04. The ICD-10 diagnoses associated with the ceftriaxone administrations were then obtained from the patient registry. The total number of visits per calendar year and month regardless of diagnosis was provided by the hospital. Pre-vaccine (2008-2011) and post-vaccine (2012-2015) periods were defined based on the year of vaccine introduction. Because hospital visits for otitis media (OM) are uncommon in older children, the primary analysis was restricted to children under four years of age. Ceftriaxone use was analysed in three separate diagnostic groups; otitis media, pneumonia and other , based on the associated ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Ceftriaxone was considered to be due to OM, if an ICD-10 code of Nonsuppurative otitis media (H65) or Suppurative and unspecified otitis media (H66) were recorded. It was considered due to pneumonia if ICD-10 codes Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) or Pneumonia, unspecified organism (J18) were recorded. Visits associated with ceftriaxone administration that did not fall into either of the above categories were classified together as “Other”. The number of ceftriaxone treatment episodes per diagnostic group was aggregated by calendar month. An episode was considered distinct if no ceftriaxone administration was documented in the previous fourteen days. Incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-years were calculated by dividing the monthly number of ceftriaxone episodes per diagnostic group by the number of person-years accrued by children in the referral area. The IR of OM visits were similarly defined and calculated. If a decrease were to be observed in the number of ceftriaxone treated OM episodes, it could be due to either a decrease in the number of OM visits or a decrease in the use of ceftriaxone. To evaluate this, the incidence risk of ceftriaxone treated OM episodes was calculated per 1,000 OM episodes presenting to Children’s Hospital Iceland for both the pre- and post-vaccine periods. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.4.4. (R Core Team 2018) using the epiR package (Stevenson et al. 2017). Incidence rate ratios (\\(IRR\\)) were calculated between the pre- and post-vaccine periods, and were estimated independently for each age-strata. The stratum-specific estimates were combined (when appropriate) using the Mantel-Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using the delta procedure (Kirkwood and Sterne 2003). The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the incidence rate ratio (\\(IRR_{MH}\\)) is the weighted mean of the \\(IRR\\) in each stratum. The null-hypothesis that \\(IRR_{MH} = 1\\) was tested by calculating the Mantel-Haenszel \\(\\chi^2\\) test statistic, from which the P-value was derived. Combining stratum-specific estimates is appropriate when the exposure-outcome association is the same in each of the strata, i.e. \\(IRR_{age} = IRR_{MH}\\) The \\(\\chi^2\\) test of heterogeneity assesses whether the data is congruent with the null hypothesis which predicts no effect modification of the exposure-outcome relationship by strata. The greater the differences is between \\(IRR_{age}\\) and \\(IRR_{MH}\\), the larger the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the \\(IRR_{MH}\\) is not calculated and only the stratum-specific \\(IRR\\) are presented. 4.3 Impact on primary care visits for otitis media (Paper II) The objective of Paper II was to evaluate the impact of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of otitis media in Icelandic children. Paper II is a whole-population observational cohort study that followed all children born in Iceland between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2015, from birth until three years of age, death or end of the study period. All primary care visits in which an ICD-10 diagnostic code of suppurative otitis media (H66) was recorded were included. Any visits occurring within 30 days of a previously documented visit by the same child were excluded from the main analysis. Data was obtained from the Primary Care Registry of the Icelandic Directorate of Health. In addition to the diagnosis of otitis media, the data included all ICD-10 codes associated with the visit, as well as the date of the visit, age and gender of the child, and physician identification number. The study identification number used to identify unique individuals is derived from the national identification numbers issued individuals by the government. Those who had immigrated to Iceland after birth were excluded. Demographic population data was obtained from Statistics Iceland. Cohorts were defined based on year of birth or vaccine eligibility. Birth-cohorts 2005–2010 were grouped as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC) and birth-cohorts 2011–2015 as vaccine eligible cohorts (VEC). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. (R Core Team 2018) using the R packages; survival (Therneau 2018), RMS (Harrell, Jr. 2018) and epiR (Stevenson et al. 2017). Crude IR of OM visits were calculated per 100 person-years at risk for each birth cohort, stratified by four-month age brackets. Following each OM visit, there was a 30 day period in which it was impossible for a visit to be recorded due to the study design. To avoid misclassifying this period, the individual time at-risk was carefully constructed to exclude the 30 days following each recorded otitis media visit. Crude IRR between VNEC and VEC were calculated and confidence intervals estimated assuming Poisson variance. In the subset of children who had full follow-up time, the number of children who cumulatively experienced 0-12 episodes of OM were tabulated, and the distribution between VNEC and VEC compared using the \\(\\chi^2\\) test of homogeneity, Additionally, the crude risk ratio between the VEC and VNEC of experiencing 0, 1–4, or &gt;5 episodes of OM before three years of age was calculated. The Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox regression model for repeated events was used to model data on the individual level and to account for censoring of follow-up time (Andersen and Gill 1982). To correct for successive visits by the same individual, Lin and Wei (1989) sandwich variance estimates were used. From this model, the hazard ratio (HR) of OM visits between each birth-cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort was calculated. The impact of PHiD-CV10 on OM visits was defined as 1 – (\\(HR\\) between the last vaccine-eligible birth cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort) * 100%. The HR between VNEC and VEC was calculated for each number of previous OM visits, and the mean number of episodes as a function of age was estimated from the model using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimator (Cook and Lawless 2007b). To determine the number of OM episodes prevented in the first five years of the vaccination, each child’s follow-up time was multiplied by the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the mean number of episodes. The absolute reduction in the incidence rate was then calculated by dividing the estimated number of prevented episodes with the total person-time of the VEC. 4.4 Impact on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions (Paper III) The objective of Paper III was to estimate the impact of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions among children in Iceland. Paper III is a whole population observational cohort study of antimicrobial prescriptions in children under three years of age in Iceland. Eleven consecutive Icelandic birth-cohorts 2005–2015 were followed from birth until three years of age. Children who immigrated to Iceland after birth were excluded. Follow-up time was censored on death, emigration, or the end of the study period (December 31, 2016). Because of shortened follow-up time, the 2016 birth-cohort was not included in the analysis. Data regarding outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions was obtained from the National Drug Prescription Registry, as previously described in 4.1.5. Data on primary care visits for respiratory tract infections was collected from the Primary Care Registry using the ICD-10 codes in Table 4.1. Prescriptions filled within three days of a documented physician visit by the same child were linked. Because data from the Primary Care Registry was only available through December 31, 2015, the portion of the analysis pertaining to the linked data was restricted to that date. Demographic population data was acquired from Statistics Iceland (https://www.statice.is/). Data was analysed both descriptively and from a cohort perspective. Descriptive analysis included all Icelandic children under three years of age during the study period. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. (R Core Team 2018) using the R packages survival (Therneau 2018), RMS (Harrell, Jr. 2018) and epiR (Stevenson et al. 2017). Based on a previously published study, all filled antimicrobial prescriptions were classified into one of six categories; first and second line penicillins, first and second generation macrolides, cephalosporins, and finally, others (Youngster et al. 2017). The proportion of prescriptions within each category was calculated by calendar-year. Five diagnostic-groups were defined, based on primary care ICD-10 diagnoses, and the proportion of cases resulting in an antimicrobial prescription was calculated per calendar-year. The five diagnostic-groups were; Acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), Other acute lower respiratory infections (J20-J22), AOM (H65, H66 and H72) and Other viral infections (B34). Birth-cohorts were compared either individually, or grouped by vaccine eligibility. In the individual birth-cohort analysis, each birth-cohort was compared to the last vaccine non-eligible cohort, i.e. the 2010 birth-cohort. Birth-cohorts 2011–2015 were grouped as vaccine-eligible cohorts (VEC), and birth-cohorts 2005–2010 as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC). The incidence rate (\\(IR\\)) of antimicrobial prescriptions per 100 person-years was calculated in six-month age-brackets for each birth-cohort. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were estimated using the Wald method (Kirkwood and Sterne 2003). Incidence rate ratios (\\(IRR\\)) between the VNEC and the VEC were estimated, and 95% confidence intervals calculated assuming Poisson variance. The cumulative proportion of children who had filled at least one antimicrobial prescription by three years of age, was calculated and compared between the VEC and VNEC using the \\(\\chi^2\\) test of homogeneity. The cumulative number of prescriptions by three years of age per child, was categorized as &lt;1, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14 and ≥ 15 prescriptions. The ratio between VNEC and VEC was then calculated for each of these categories. The 2014 and 2015-cohorts were excluded from the cumulative analyses, as they did not have the full three-year follow-up time. The Andersen-Gill time-to-event model was fitted to the individual level data (Andersen and Gill 1982). It was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of antimicrobial prescription between the study birth-cohorts, which were included in the model as a categorical variable. Age was accounted for by defining it as the model’s underlying measurement of time. The model was stratified by gender to allow for independent baseline hazards. The number of previous antimicrobial prescriptions was included in the model, and its effect allowed to be non-linear by means of restricted cubic splines (Cook and Lawless 2007a). Lin and Wei (1989) robust sandwich variance estimates were applied to account for the correlation between successive prescriptions filled by the same child. The impact of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions was estimated as 1 – (the hazard ratio between the last vaccine eligible and last vaccine non-eligible cohort) * 100%. The impact on each successive prescription was also estimated. Finally, the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimate of the mean number of antimicrobial prescriptions for each gender and vaccine-cohort was calculated (Cook and Lawless 2007b). To estimate the absolute number of prevented antimicrobial prescriptions during the first seven years of the intervention, the following formula was utilized; first, the expected number of prescriptions per child was added together by multiplying each child’s follow-up time with the VNEC estimate of the mean number of prescriptions per child. Next, the expected number of prescriptions per child was estimated using the VEC estimate of the mean. Finally, the absolute number prevented was calculated by subtracting the VEC total from the VNEC total. The absolute rate reduction was then calculated by dividing the absolute number prevented, with the number of person-years at-risk in the VEC. A sub-analysis was performed to estimate the vaccine impact against OM-associated antimicrobial prescriptions. The above described regression methodology was applied to those antimicrobial prescriptions that were linked to a primary care physician visit resulting in a diagnosis of AOM. 4.5 Impact on tympanostomy tube procedures (Paper IV) The objective of Paper IV was to estimate the impact of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of tympanostomy tube placements (TTP) among children in Iceland. Paper IV is an individual level observational cohort study of all outpatient TTP procedures in Iceland. The study period is from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2016. Eleven consecutive birth-cohorts 2005-2015, were followed from birth until five years of age, or end of the study period. Children who immigrated to Iceland after birth were excluded from the analysis. Those children who emigrated were censored from the study on the date of emigration. This allowed for accurate person-year at risk calculations. Data on outpatient TTP was obtained from the Icelandic Health Insurance reimbursement database, using reimbursement codes compatible with TTP (Table 4.5). Information regarding inpatient TTP was extracted from Landspitali University Hospital’s patient registry using NCSP codes (Table 4.2). These data were linked with data on primary care and emergency department visits for otitis media (OM). Data on primary care visits was obtained from the Primary Care Registry, and information regarding emergency department visits was extracted from the hospital’s patient registry. Primary care data was only available until December 31, 2015. A visit was considered to be due to OM if an ICD-10 diagnostic code of Non-suppurative otitis media (H65), Suppurative otitis media (H66), Mastoiditis (H70) or Perforation of tympanic membrane (H72) was recorded. A repeat visit within 30 days was assumed to represent the same episode, and was excluded. Data regarding filled antimicrobial prescriptions was extracted from the National Drug Prescription Registry using ATC code J01 (antibacterials for systemic use). Cohorts were defined based on year of birth or vaccine eligibility. Birth-cohorts 2005-2010 were classified as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC) and birth-cohorts 2011-2015 as vaccine-eligible cohorts (VEC). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. (R Core Team 2018) using the R packages; survival (Therneau 2018), RMS (Harrell, Jr. 2018) and epiR (Stevenson et al. 2017). Crude incidence rates (IR) of TTP per 100 person-years were calculated for each birth-cohort in 6-month age-groups. Crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) between the VEC and VNEC were calculated, and 95% confidence intervals estimated assuming Poisson variance. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimate was used to calculate the cumulative proportion of TTP procedures for each birth-cohort, and confidence intervals calculated using the log delta method. The comparison of the risk of TTP between birth-cohorts was adjusted for two confounders; the number of prior OM diagnoses and the number of prior antimicrobial prescriptions. Among children who had undergone TTP and had the full five year follow-up time, the distribution in the number of previous visits and prescriptions was compared between VNEC and VEC using the \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence. When adjusting for the number of previous visits, four years was considered full follow-up time due to restricted data. If a significant difference was detected, the risk ratio and absolute risk difference between VEC and VNEC were calculated, stratified by the prior number of visits or antimicrobial prescriptions. Confidence intervals were estimated with the \\(\\chi^2\\) of independence. A Cox regression model was constructed to accurately account for the influence of age and censored follow-up time. Three separate models were estimated. The first did not adjust for prior OM visits or antimicrobial prescriptions, while the later two did. The Cox regression model using the number of previous OM visits was censored at December 31, 2015 due to restricted data. Each Cox model was stratified by gender. Correlation between repeated observations of the same child was adjusted, using Lin and Wei (1989) sandwich variance estimates. The hazard ratio (HR) of TTP was estimated between each of the study’s birth-cohorts. The vaccine impact of PHiD-CV against TTP was estimated as 1 – (the hazard ratio between the last vaccine eligible cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort) * 100%. 4.6 Impact on respiratory associated hospitalizations (Paper V) The objective of Paper V was to estimate the impact of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of pediatric hospitalizations due to diseases commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumonae. Paper V is a single-center, individual-level, observational cohort study of pediatric hospitalizations. Eleven consecutive Icelandic birth-cohorts 2005-2015 were followed from birth until three years of age. Immigration and emigration data obtained from Statistics Iceland was used to exclude children who had immigrated to Iceland after birth. Included were all hospital admissions to the Children’s Hospital Iceland January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2016. The Children’s Hospital Iceland is the primary pediatric hospital for approximately 90% of Iceland’s population (www.statice.is), and serves as a secondary and tertiary pediatric hospital for the entire country. Data on admissions was collected from Landspitali University Hospital’s patient registry. Microbiological data was extracted from a database maintained by the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Landspitali University Hospital. Seven diagnostic groups were defined in this paper. Five of these represent diseases commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia and otitis media. The remaining two groups, upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and other lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), were included as comparators. Hospitalization was categorized in a diagnostic group, if the relevant ICD-10 diagnostic code was recorded on the discharge chart, or if the admission was associated with microbiologically-confirmed IPD. Admissions with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses compatible with meningitis (G00) were grouped as meningitis. Those with A40 or A41 diagnoses were grouped as sepsis; with J09-J18, as pneumonia; J20-J22 as LRTI; H65, H66, H70 and H72 as OM; and J01-J06 as URTI (Table 4.6). A hospitalization was considered to be due to IPD if associated with culture or PCR confirmed Streptococcus pneumoniae sampled from joint fluid, bone, cerebrospinal fluid or blood, regardless of ICD-10 discharge diagnosis. Table 4.6: Definitions of the Paper V’s diagnostic groupings Diagnostic group Abbreviation Definition Meningitis - ICD-10 discharge diagnosis of G00 Sepsis - ICD-10 discharge diagnosis of A41 or A42 Pneumonia - ICD-10 discharge diagnosis of J09-J18 Otitis media and complications OM ICD-10 discharge diagnosis of H65, H66, H70 or H72 Acute upper respiratory tract infections URTI ICD-10 discharge diagnosis of J00-J06 Acute lower respiratory tract infections LRTI ICD-10 discharge diagnosis of J20-J22 Invasive pneumococcal disease IPD Microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal infection from normally sterile site, regardless of ICD-10 diagnosis Birth-cohorts were compared either individually, or grouped by vaccine eligibility. In the individual birth-cohort analysis, each birth-cohort was compared to the last vaccine non-eligible cohort, i.e. the 2010 birth-cohort. Birth-cohorts 2011–2015 were grouped as vaccine-eligible cohorts (VEC), and birth-cohorts 2005–2010 as vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.4. (R Core Team 2018) using the R packages; survival (Therneau 2018), RMS (Harrell, Jr. 2018) and epiR (Stevenson et al. 2017). Mean age at hospitalization was calculated for each birth-cohort and diagnostic group. Analysis of variance was used to test whether significant difference existed between cohorts. If an overall difference was identified, the analysis was followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference procedure. The median hospital length of stay was calculated for each diagnostic group, and compared between cohorts using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Crude incidence rates (\\(IR\\)) of hospital admissions were calculated for each birth-cohort, diagnostic group and age group, and incidence rate ratios (\\(IRR\\)) were calculated between the VNEC and VEC assuming Poisson variance. The proportion of hospitalizations which led to admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was calculated by birth-cohort and diagnostic group. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was used to calculate both event-free survival, as well as the event-free survival difference of the VNEC compared to the VEC for each of the diagnostic groups. Subsequent hospitalizations of the same child with the same discharge diagnosis were excluded from this portion of the analysis. Follow-up time was censored upon emigration or death. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio of admission between the VNEC and VEC. To clarify whether potential differences between VNEC and VEC were likely to be due to direct effects of the vaccine, the Cox regression was repeated for two restricted age-ranges; 0-90 days of age and 90 days and older. A sensitivity analysis of potential unmeasured confounding of the hazard ratio was calculated using E-values (VanderWeele and Ding 2017). An E-value represents the minimum association an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, to completely explain away the observed association. 4.7 Impact and cost-effectiveness analysis (Paper VI) The objective of Paper VI was estimate the population impact of PHiD-CV10 on several aspects of pneumococcal disease and calculate the cost-effectiveness of PHiD-CV10 introduction. Considered were otitis media visits to primary care among children 0-19 years of age, and hospitalizations due to pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease among the whole population. The study period was from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2017 and the study population included all Icelandic citizens. The data was analysed as a time-series, and incorporated synthetic controls. 4.7.1 Data sources Data were extracted from several population based registries. Primary care visits with ICD-10 diagnoses compatible with otitis media (H65, H66, H70, H72) were extracted from the Primary Care Registry. The observation period was restricted to 2005-2015, as the Primary Care Registry has not been updated for 2016 and 2017. Data regarding hospitalized pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease were extracted from Landspitali University Hospital’s patient registry. Microbiological data were extracted from a database maintained by the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Landspitali University Hospital and linked to the patient registry. A hospitalization was considered to be due to invasive pneumococcal disease if associated with culture or PCR confirmed Streptococcus pneumoniae sampled from joint fluid, bone, cerebrospinal fluid or blood, regardless of ICD-10 discharge diagnosis. Hospitalizations with ICD-10 diagnoses compatible with pneumonia (J09-J18) were obtained directly from the patient registry. The aggregate number of visits and hospitalizations per calendar-month for diagnoses unrelated to Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were also extracted from both registries and used as synthetic controls (Table 4.3). Data regarding the cost of hospitalization were obtained directly from the patient registry. For each hospitalization, a detailed breakdown of cost was available, which was extracted for each of the hospitalizations included in the study. No cost data is available for primary care visits. Because Children’s Hospital Iceland’s pediatric emergency department serves as a walk-in clinic for the greater capital area, the distribution of costs for otitis media visits to the emergency department was assumed to mirror that of primary care visits. The cost of otitis media visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland was extracted from the patient registry. The consumer price index for medical care obtained from Statistics Iceland was used to convert all direct healthcare costs to constant 2011 ISK. The deciles of regular total wage for the calendar-year 2011, were obtained from Statistics Iceland. These were optimally fitted to a lognormal distribution to obtain a continoues distribution of wage. The number of days of work lost were calculated using distributional assumptions. For each case of otitis media in primary care, the days of work lost by a parent or guardian were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with mean equalling one. For each pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease hospitalization, the days of work lost was assumed to equal the sum of the hospital length of stay, and a Poisson distribution with mean equalling one. 4.7.2 Statistical analysis The cost-effectiveness analysis was completed in two separate steps. First, the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction into the pediatric vaccination program in Iceland was estimated. This was accomplished using a previously published Bayesian time-series methodology (Bruhn et al. 2017; Shioda et al. 2018). The pre-vaccine period was defined as January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, and the post-vaccine period as April 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. For each disease category and age-group, four models of PHiD-CV10 impact were estimated. All were Bayesian Poisson models with observation specific random intercepts to account for over-dispersion (Dvorzak and Wagner 2016). Each model utilized the pre-vaccine period to predict the monthly occurrence of the outcome of interest in the post-vaccine period, had the vaccination not occurred. The simplest model was a time-series without an offset term. Calender-month effects were accounted for using dummy variables. The time-series model used the pre-vaccine period to estimate the trend. It predicted the monthly number of cases of the disease category, assuming the pre-vaccine trend would have continued if the vaccination had not occurred. A second, similar time-series model was also estimated, but included an offset term of all non-respiratory visits. This model used the pre-vaccine period to estimate the relationship between the outcome of interest and all non-respiratory visits. It also predicted the occurrence in the post-vaccine period assuming the relationship would not have changed, had the vaccination not occurred. The third model included synthetic controls as covariates and used Bayesian variable selection to choose which of them to include (Bruhn et al. 2017). The prior for each synthetic control was set as a Dirac spike with a point-mass at zero. The pre-vaccine period was used to estimate the relationship between the synthetic controls and the outcome of interest, and to select the optimal controls. This relationship was used to predict the trend in the post-vaccine period, had the vaccination not occurred. Finally, a two-step model was fitted, using a seasonal and trend decomposition (STL) and principal component analysis (PCA) (Shioda et al. 2018). STL was used to extract a smoothed trend for each of the synthetic controls. PCA was then used to extract the first principal component, which was used as a covariate in the final prediction model. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to calibrate the models, using data from the pre-vaccine period. The LOOCV was also used to calculate the average point-wise likelihood for each model, diagnostic category and age-group. The average point-wise likelihoods were used as weights in a Bayesian model stacking procedure, which produced the final stacked model used in the analysis. The stacked model was used to generate a posterior distribution of the number of cases which would have occurred, had the vaccine not been introduced. From this posterior distribution, 10,000 estimates of the number of cases per calendar-month in post-vaccine period were drawn, of which the first 2,000 were discarded for optimal burn-in. The observed number of cases were subtracted from the remaining 8,000 draws, which produced 8,000 draws of the total number of cases prevented by the vaccine introduction. For each draw, the cumulative sum of the number of prevented cases was calculated, and the median and 95% credible intervals extracted. The direct cumulative cost associated with the vaccination was calculated by bootstraping from the distribution of costs per case, and multiplying by the number of prevented cases. From this the cost of the vaccine was subtracted. This resulted in 8,000 posterior draws of the estimated vaccine cost, from which the median and 95% credible intervals were extracted. References "],

Because data was collected over a four year period from 2013-2017, and the papers that form this thesis were written and published at different times, the study period and population described in each paper varies slightly. They differ however only marginally from the final data summary described below. When data from all registries are taken together, individual level information was available for 375,383 Icelandic citizens, of which 183,544 were female and 181,316 were male. Gender was unknown for 10,523 individuals. The full date of birth was known for 366,188 and birth-year was available for the rest. The median birth-year for the whole study population was 1979 (IQR 1958-1997). Death was registered for 12,308 individuals during the study period. Several papers examined the data, stratified by birth-cohort. The number of children in each birth-cohort who contributed data to the present study are shown in Table 5.1.

Of the 57,695 Icelandic children born 2005 or later, 5,577 moved to or from the country 6,847 times. The proportion of children in each birth-cohort who moved at least once before five years of age, was consistently 9%-12% of those birth-cohorts who had full follow-up time (birth-cohorts 2005-2012). 5.1.2 Landspitali University Hospital patient registry All visits and hospitalizations with ICD-10 diagnostic codes compatible with respiratory infections (Table 4.1) and procedural codes compatible with tympanostomy tube procedures (Table 4.2), were extracted from Landspitali’s patient registry. The number of visits and hospitalizations corresponding to each of the study’s ICD-10 codes recorded in the first diagnostic field, are shown in Table 5.2.

Figure 5.1: Total number of contacts to Landspitali University Hospital and Primary Care Centers 5.1.3 The Primary Care Registry The Primary Care Registry recorded all primary care health contacts for the period 2005-2015. All physician contacts associated with the diagnostic codes listed in Table 4.1 were extracted for that given period. A total of 1,963,439 separate contacts were recorded between 298,307 individual patients and 1,266 different physicians. The most visits for a single individual was 212. The distribution of contacts by age can be seen in Figure 5.1. 5.1.4 The National Vaccine Registry The National Vaccine Registry recorded all administered vaccine doses for the period 2005-2017. All recorded pneumococcal vaccine doses were extracted. A total of 110,712 doses of pneumococcal vaccines were administered to 51,601 individuals during the study period. The monthly number of administered doses per age-group and vaccine is shown in Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2: Monthly number of administered pneumococcal vaccine doses by type and age-group Table 5.4 shows the number of children in each birth-cohort who had received zero, one, two, or three doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by four years of age. Children who moved to or from the country before four years of age, were excluded from the table.

Figure 5.3: Age at the time of administered pneumococcal vaccine dose by birth date 5.1.5 The National Drug Prescription Registry The National Drug Prescription Registry (NDPR) recorded all filled prescriptions from 2005-2017. From this registry, all antibacterials for systemic use (J01), vaccines (J07), opthalmologicals (S01) and otologicals (S02) were extracted. A total of 4,020,624 prescriptions were recorded among 360,560 individuals. The number of prescriptions by therapeutic subgroup of the ATC classification system is shown in Table 5.5. The highest number of antimicrobial prescriptions filled by a single individual was 336 during the study period.

Figure 5.4: Antimicrobial prescriptions by age 5.1.6 Reimbursement database of Icelandic Health Insurance All interactions with independent health care practitioners were recorded in Icelandic Health Insurance’s reimbursement database. From this database, all records of otolaryngological procedures were extracted. A total of 51,814 procedures were recorded among 34,084 individuals. 5.2 Impact on otitis media with treatment failure (Paper I) The total number of children under eighteen years of age who lived within Children’s Hospital Iceland’s referral region remained stable during the study period, decreasing from 62,067 in 2008 to 61,798 in 2015. The variation was more pronounced in the number of children under four years of age in the same region, which increased from 13,562 in 2008 to 14,644 in 2011, and then decreased to 13,272 in 2015. During the period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2015, 103,220 visits were recorded to the Children’s Hospital Iceland. The visits varied over the calendar year, spiking in the winter months and troughing in the summer months. The total number of visits increased steadily during the study period, from 12,229 in 2008 to 14,502 in 2015, as shown in Figure 5.5. Figure 5.5: Monthly number of visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland During the same period, 6,232 visits to the Children’s Hospital Iceland for acute otitis media were recorded for 4,624 individual children under four years of age, representing 4,994 distinct episodes. Of those episodes, 531 were treated with one or more doses of ceftriaxone. The total number of visits, visits for AOM and ceftriaxone treatment episodes are shown in Table 5.6, Table 5.6: Incidence rates of visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland and parenteral ceftriaxone by calendar-year Year Total (n) AOM (n) Total (n) AOM (n) Total (n) AOM (n) 2008 197 (12,229) 69 (936) 80.8 (988) 186 (174) 15.9 (988) 72.9 (174) 2009 199 (12,514) 72 (1,012) 74.8 (936) 192 (194) 14.9 (936) 66.5 (194) 2010 181 (11,339) 64.2 (925) 81 (918) 253 (234) 14.6 (918) 63.7 (234) 2011 201 (12,645) 60.8 (890) 63.8 (807) 178 (158) 12.8 (807) 55.1 (158) 2012 215 (13,150) 58.4 (830) 52.5 (691) 163 (135) 11.3 (691) 48.6 (135) 2013 221 (13,518) 55.2 (772) 54.7 (739) 105 (81) 12.1 (739) 52.8 (81) 2014 216 (13,323) 52 (708) 48.9 (652) 76.3 (54) 10.6 (652) 47.9 (54) 2015 235 (14,502) 55.1 (731) 56.7 (822) 88.9 (65) 13.3 (822) 61.9 (65) The incidence rate of AOM visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland decreased significantly in the post-vaccine period as compared to the pre-vaccine period; from 47.4 visits per 1000 person-years to 41.8 per 1000 person-years. The crude IRR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83–0.93; P &lt; 0.001). Manel-Haenszel adjustment was not appropriate due to effect heterogeneity (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 15.2, P &lt; 0.001). When each age-group was examined separately, a significant decrease in AOM visits was observed among children between one and two years of age (IRR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.93-0.96; P = 0.00341) and between two and three years of age (IRR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71–0.88; P &lt; 0.001), as shown in Table 5.7. Children under one year of age and children between three and four years of age, visited the Children’s Hospital Iceland because of AOM 471 times and 379 times, respectively. Table 5.7: Incidence rate ratios of AOM visits between the pre- and post-vaccine periods Age (years) IRR (95% CI) Chi-squared P-value &lt;1 1.10 (0.90-1.30) 0.80 0.37000 1-2 0.89 (0.83-0.96) 8.60 0.00341 2-3 0.79 (0.71-0.88) 17.00 &lt; 0.001 3-4 1.00 (0.85-1.30) 0.22 0.63900 Independent of this decrease in visits, the incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes for AOM was also found to decrease significantly in the post-vaccine period compared to the pre-vaccine period. The effect was heterogeneous across age-strata (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 57, P &lt; 0.001) and the crude overall IRR was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.40–0.58; P &lt; 0.001). The stratum specific results are shown in Table 5.8. During study period, only 17 episodes of AOM were treated with ceftriaxone among children zero to one years of age and 19 episodes among children three to four years of age. Table 5.8: Incidence rate ratios of ceftriaxone treatment episodes of AOM between the pre- and post-vaccine periods Age (years) IRR (95% CI) Chi-squared P-value &lt;1 0.61 (0.19-1.80) 0.96 0.326 1-2 0.47 (0.37-0.60) 41.00 &lt;0.001 2-3 0.47 (0.32-0.68) 18.00 &lt;0.001 3-4 0.85 (0.31-2.30) 0.12 0.732 Part of the observed decrease of ceftriaxone treatment episodes for AOM could conceivably be explained by a decrease in the number of AOM cases presenting to the Children’s Hospital Iceland. Because of this possibility, the risk of receiving ceftriaxone treatment if presenting to Children’s Hospital Iceland with AOM was calculated and a significant decrease was noted. The risk decrease was not homogeneous across age-strata (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 33.8, P &lt; 0.001) and the overall relative risk ratio of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.48-0.69; P &lt; 0.001). The stratum specific effects are shown in Table 5.9 Table 5.9: Incidence risk ratio of ceftriaxone treatment episodes of AOM adjusted for the number of AOM visits between the pre- and post-vaccine periods Age (years) IRR (95% CI) Chi-squared P-value &lt;1 0.56 (0.17-1.70) 1.30 0.25800 1-2 0.53 (0.42-0.67) 26.00 &lt; 0.001 2-3 0.59 (0.40-0.86) 7.50 0.00607 3-4 0.81 (0.29-2.20) 0.19 0.66200 Decreases were noted in the incidence of AOM visits, in ceftriaxone treatment episodes of AOM and in risk of ceftriaxone treatment if presenting to the Children’s Hospital Iceland. A similar decrease was noted in the ceftriaxone treatment episodes for pneumonia. In the pre-vaccine period, 251 treatment episodes were recorded but in the post-vaccine period, only 90 were recorded. The effect was not consistent across age-strata (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 72, P-value &lt; 0.001). The overall incidence rate ratio was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.29-0.47; P &lt; 0.001). The stratum specific effects are shown in Table 5.10. Table 5.10: Incidence risk ratio of ceftriaxone treatment episodes of pneumonia between the pre- and post-vaccine periods Age (years) IRR (95% CI) Chi-squared P-value &lt;1 0.15 (0.017-0.64) 8.6 0.00345 1-2 0.34 (0.220-0.51) 33.0 &lt; 0.001 2-3 0.36 (0.230-0.54) 28.0 &lt; 0.001 3-4 0.51 (0.290-0.89) 6.4 0.01170 To ascertain whether a decrease in ceftriaxone use had occurred in vaccinated children for non-vaccine related indications, the incidence of ceftriaxone for all other indications was examined, and was shown to have not decreased significantly. There was no heterogeneity across age-strata (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 0.56, P-value = 0.455). The Mantel-Haenszel adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87-1.06; P = 0.262). The number of treatment episodes by age and vaccine period ranged from 117 to 295. The stratum specific incidence rate ratios are shown in Table 5.11. Table 5.11: Incidence risk ratio of ceftriaxone treatment episodes with indications other than AOM and pneumonia between the pre- and post-vaccine periods Age (years) IRR (95% CI) Chi-squared P-value &lt;1 1.30 (1.10-1.50) 7.60 0.00597 1-2 0.86 (0.70-1.00) 2.40 0.12100 2-3 0.73 (0.58-0.91) 8.00 0.00473 3-4 0.90 (0.70-1.20) 0.62 0.43200 Quarterly incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes by indication are shown in Figure 5.6. Figure 5.6: Quarterly incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes by indication 2008-2015 To further test whether a general decrease was occurring in the overall use of ceftriaxone, rather than a specific decrease for vaccine-related indications in vaccinated children, an examination of ceftriaxone treatment episodes in all children regardless of age and indication was undertaken. An overall decrease in the incidence rate of ceftriaxone treatment episodes was noted in the post-vaccine period compared to the pre-vaccine period, among children under eighteen years of age regardless of indication. These rates declined from 11.11 treatment episodes per 1000 person-years to 9.55 episodes per 1000 person-years, IRR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81-0.91; P &lt; 0.001). The effect was not consistent across age-groups (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 23.6, P-value &lt; 0.001). When examined by age-group, the overall decrease proved to be driven by a decrease in the youngest age-group – i.e the children who were protected by the vaccination. The incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes did not decrease significantly in other age groups (Figure 5.7). Figure 5.7: Incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes by age-group and calendar time 5.3 Impact on primary care visits for otitis media (Paper II) The demographics of the study birth-cohorts are described in Chapter 5.1 and Table 5.1. A total of 92,935 primary care visits due to AOM were recorded among birth-cohorts 2005-2015 during the study period. The crude incidence rate of AOM visits to primary care per 100 person-years in the VNEC and VEC was 45.3 and 39.8 respectively. The incidence rate and number of AOM visits by birth-cohort and gender is shown in Table 5.12. Table 5.12: Incidence rate and number of visits by birth-cohort and gender Birth-cohort Females Males 2005 41.9 (2,777) 49.0 (3,439) 2006 46.1 (3,096) 50.9 (3,605) 2007 45.7 (3,118) 50.3 (3,646) 2008 46.2 (3,259) 45.3 (3,419) 2009 40.9 (2,981) 47.0 (3,649) 2010 45.0 (3,207) 47.0 (3,523) 2011 39.1 (2,631) 44.1 (3,164) 2012 40.6 (2,760) 41.8 (2,977) 2013 38.0 (2,125) 42.8 (2,322) 2014 37.4 (1,200) 44.0 (1,465) 2015 15.8 (157) 20.8 (222) The lowest incidence was observed in children zero to three months of age. Thereafter, the incidence increased sharply, and peaked in children eight to eleven and twelve to fifteen months of age, after which it decreased again. The crude IR decreased significantly in all age-groups, with incidence rate ratios ranging from 0.60-0.94. The largest and visually most consistent decrease in incidence was noted among children zero to three months of age, IRR 0.6 (95%CI 0.51-0.69), Figure 5.8 Figure 5.8: Incidence of acute otitis media visits to primary care by age-group and birth-cohort When tabulated by the cumulative number of AOM episodes experienced by each child, the proportion of children experiencing zero episodes of AOM increased in the VEC compared to the VNEC, while the proportion experiencing one to four episodes and five or more decreased, as shown in Table 5.13. Table 5.13: The proportion and 95% confidence interval for the vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC, born: 2005–2010) and the vaccine eligible cohorts (VEC, born 2011–2013) that recorded 0, 1–4, and 5-12 cumulative visits for AOM at 36 months of age. No. visits VNEC (%) VEC (%) Incidence risk (95%CI) 0 40.0 43.2 1.14 (1.10-1.18) 1-4 55.7 53.2 0.904 (0.876-0.932) 5-12 4.23 3.58 0.84 (0.744-0.946) Discrimination indices for the Andersen-Gill multiple event model were adequate, Nagelkerke’s \\(R^2\\) = 0.110 and Somer’s \\(D_{xy}\\) = 0.238. A diagnostic plot of Schoenfeld residuals was used to visually assess the proportional hazard assumption for each covariate and no systematic deviations were detected. The model was used to estimate the hazard ratio between each of the study’s birth-cohorts and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort, 2010. There was little variation in the hazard of AOM between the VNEC. Only the 2007 birth-cohort differed significantly, with a hazard ratio of 1.06 (95%CI 1.01-1.12) compared to the 2010 birth-cohort. An abrupt and significant decrease in the hazard of AOM was noted in the first vaccine eligible cohort, which continued for all remaining VEC (Figure 5.9). The estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 on AOM visits to primary care among children under three years of age was 21% (95%CI 11%-30%). Figure 5.9: Estimated hazard ratio between each of the study’s birth-cohorts and the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort When the hazard ratio of AOM visits between VEC and VNEC was stratified by the number of previous AOM associated primary care visits, the vaccine impact was discernable in children who had either no or only one previous AOM visit. Among children who had more than one previous AOM associated visit, no effect was found (Figure 5.10). Figure 5.10: Estimated hazard ratio of AOM between VEC and VNEC stratified by the number of previous visits The mean number of AOM visits to primary care as a function of age was calculated using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimate on the underlying Andersen-Gill model. By their fourth birthday, the average child in the VNEC had experienced 1.61 episodes of AOM. The average child in the VEC had experienced 1.37. The mean number of AOM episodes by age is shown in Figure 5.11. Figure 5.11: Mean number of AOM episodes by age in the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible cohorts 5.4 Impact on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions (Paper III) Demographic data regarding the study birth-cohorts are summarized in Chapter 5.1 and Table 5.1. From 2005-2012, first-line penicillins were prescribed most commonly and represented between 41% and 47% of all antimicrobial prescriptions. Their use decreased suddenly in 2013 to 32%, and represented only 18% of all antimicrobial prescriptions in 2014 and 2015. During this same period, the use of second-line penicillins went from 35%-40% from 2005-2012, to 48%, 55% and 54% in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Use of cephalosporins followed a similar trend – there use represented between 5.2% and 7.8% of all prescriptions 2005–2012, and increased to 10–15% between 2013–2016.

The proportion of otitis media visits resulting in an antimicrobial prescription remained stable at between 57% and 64% of visits. The incidence of otitis media associated prescriptions decreased from a high of 54.9 prescriptions per 100 person-years in 2008 to 39.8 prescriptions per 100 person-years in 2015. Figure 5.12: Proportion of visits due to each diagnostic group resulting in antimicrobial prescription and incidence of associated antimicrobial prescriptions During the study period, a total of 226,084 outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions were recorded among birth-cohorts 2005-2015. The crude incidence rate of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions per 100 person-years in the VNEC and VEC was 164.6 and 150.2 respectively. The incidence rate and number of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions by birth-cohort and gender is shown in Table 5.15. Table 5.15: Incidence rate and number of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions by birth-cohort and gender Birth-cohort Females Males 2005 176.0 (11,178) 200.0 (13,423) 2006 167.0 (10,843) 190.0 (13,109) 2007 153.0 (10,140) 174.0 (12,339) 2008 153.0 (10,543) 171.0 (12,492) 2009 151.0 (10,699) 169.0 (12,775) 2010 150.0 (10,366) 161.0 (11,854) 2011 142.0 ( 9,230) 156.0 (10,906) 2012 142.0 ( 9,447) 158.0 (11,058) 2013 138.0 ( 9,015) 158.0 (10,180) 2014 145.0 (7,726) 167.0 (9,234) 2015 138.0 (4,075) 173.0 (5,452) The lowest incidence was observed in children zero to five months of age. The incidence increased sharply thereafter and peaked in children six to eleven and twelve to seventeen months of age, after which it decreased again. The crude IR decreased significantly in all age-groups, with incidence rate ratios ranging from 0.82-0.94. The largest and visually most consistent decrease in incidence was noted among children zero to five months of age, IRR 0.82 (95%CI 0.79-0.85), Figure 5.13 Figure 5.13: Incidence of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions by age-group and birth-cohort The proportion of children in the VNEC and VEC who filled at least one antimicrobial prescription by three years of age was 88.6% and 86.8 respectively. Children in the VEC were significantly more likely than children in the VNEC not to have filled an antimicrobial prescription (incidence risk ratio 1.16, 95%CI 1.10-1.23) or to have filled only between one and four antimicrobial prescriptions (incidence risk ratio 1.08, 95%CI 1.06–1.11). The cumulative number of prescriptions by vaccine eligibility cohort in shown in Table 5.16. Table 5.16: The proportion of children in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts (VNEC, born: 2005–2010) and vaccine eligible cohorts (VEC, born 2011–2013) that had filled 0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14 and ≥ 15 prescriptions at 36 months of age.

A diagnostic plot of Schoenfeld residuals was used to visually assess the proportional hazard assumption for each covariate – no systematic deviations were detected. The model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions between each of the study’s birth-cohorts and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort, 2010. Visually, there seemed to be a decreasing trend in hazard among the vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts (Figure 5.14). The hazard did not change significantly between the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort and the preceding two cohorts, but did decrease significantly thereafter, with each vaccine eligible cohort having a significantly lower hazard of outpatient antimicrobial prescription. The estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions among children under three years of age was 8% (95%CI 4%-12%). Figure 5.14: Estimated hazard ratio between each of the study’s birth-cohorts and the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort When the hazard ratio of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions between the VEC and VNEC was stratified by the number of previous prescriptions, the vaccine impact was discernible for children who had received up to three prior antimicrobial prescriptions. Among children who had received more than three prior prescriptions, no effect was found (Figure 5.15). Figure 5.15: Estimated hazard ratio of AOM between VEC and VNEC stratified by the number of previous visits The mean number of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions as a function of age was calculated using the generalized Nelson-Aalen estimate on the underlying Andersen-Gill model. By their fourth birthday, the average male child in the VNEC had filled 6.48 antimicrobial prescriptions and the average female had filled 6.07. The average male and female in the VEC had filled 5.84 and 5.46 prescriptions respectively. The mean number of antimicrobial prescriptions by age and gender is shown in Figure 5.16. Figure 5.16: Mean number of AOM episodes by age in the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible cohorts 5.5 Impact on tympanostomy tube procedures (Paper IV) Demographic data regarding the study birth-cohorts are summarized in Chapter 5.1. In total, during the study period, 14,351 children underwent 20,373 tympanostomy tube placements, 57% of whom were male. The median age of children undergoing their first tympanostomy procedure was 17 months (IQR 13-24). In the subset of children who underwent a tympanostomy tube placement during the study period, 10,248 (71%) underwent only one procedure, 2,902 (20%) underwent two, and 1201 (8%) underwent three or more. Almost all (98%) of the procedures were performed in private outpatient clinics. The number of otolaryngologists performing outpatient tympanostomy tube placements increased from 15 in 2005 to 23 in 2016. Each surgeon performed a median of 123 (IQR: 56.5-196) procedures each year. The study’s population is summarized in Table 5.17. Table 5.17: Demographic information regarding the study’s birth-cohorts Birth-cohort Number of children Person-years Number of procedures (n children) Median age (months) 2005 4,541 21,409 1,946 (1,280) 17 (12-25) 2006 4,665 21,988 1,931 (1,303) 18 (13-27) 2007 4,770 22,500 1,974 (1,335) 18 (13-27) 2008 4,949 23,313 2,140 (1,428) 18 (13-26) 2009 5,128 24,141 2,145 (1,514) 18 (13-25) 2010 4,984 23,580 2,203 (1,547) 18 (13-26) 2011 4,642 22,056 1,997 (1,382) 18 (13-24) 2012 4,668 20,195 2,057 (1,419) 16 (12-23) 2013 4,442 14,964 1,642 (1,200) 16 (13-23) 2014 4,444 10,744 1,582 (1,251) 16 (13-20) 2015 4,136 5,983 756 (692) 13 (11-15) The crude incidence rate of tympanostomy tube placements in the vaccine eligible cohorts was 10.6 procedures per 100 person-years. This was significantly higher than the crude incidence rate in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, 8.7 procedures per 100 person-years (IRR 1.20, 95%CI 1.17-1.24). When stratified by age-groups, the crude incidence rate was highest among 12-17 month old children (Figure 5.17). Figure 5.17: Incidence of tympanostomy tube procedures by age-group and birth-cohort The cumulative incidence of children who had undergone at least one tympanostomy tube placement by five years of age was highest in birth-cohort 2010 (31.7%) and lowest in birth-cohort 2006 (28.6%), Table 5.18. The cumulative incidence of tympanostomy procedures was significantly higher in the vaccine eligible birth-cohorts compared to vaccine non-eligible cohorts regardless of age (Figure 5.18).

The distribution in the number of previous visits was significantly different between the VNEC and VEC (Chi-Squared test statistic 63.8, P&lt;.001). The proportion of children who did not have a single recorded visit prior to undergoing the procedure increased from 20.6% in the VNEC to 28.9% in the VEC, RR 1.40 (95%CI 1.28-1.54). Children in the vaccine eligible cohorts had received significantly fewer antimicrobial prescriptions prior to undergoing the procedure (Chi-Squared test statistic 53.6, P&lt;.001). The mean (median) number of previous antimicrobial prescriptions was 3.19 (4) in the vaccine eligible cohorts compared to 3.62 (4) in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts. Children in the VEC were more likely to have never been prescribed antimicrobials prior to undergoing tympanostomy placement, RR 1.52, 95%CI 1.18-1.96). The comparison between VEC and VNEC is summarized in Table 5.19.

The hazard of undergoing a tympanostomy tube procedure was considerably higher in children who had previously visited a physician for otitis media or received an antimicrobial prescription. Children who had one prior documented visit were considerably more likely to undergo the procedure than children who had no documented visits, HR of 3.12 (95%CI 2.93-3.32). Likewise, children who had previously filled one antimicrobial prescription were more likely to receive a tympanostomy tube than children who had received no prescription, 6.98 (95%CI 6.13-7.95). The hazard of tympanostomy tube placement increased gradually from birth-cohort 2005 to 2015 (Figure 5.19). Figure 5.19: The hazard ratio of undergoing a tympanostomy tube placement between each of the study’s birth-cohorts and the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort 5.6 Impact on respiratory associated hospitalizations (Paper V) Demographic data regarding the study birth-cohorts are summarized in Chapter 5.1. In total, 51,264 children were followed for a median of 1,096 days (range 6-1,096) resulting in 142,315 person-years of follow-up time. Of those, 1,414 children were admitted to hospital 1,703 times with diagnoses compatible with the study’s diagnostic groups. The total number of hospital admissions regardless of indication was 4,842. An overview of the demographic data is presented in Table 5.20.

In the same cohorts, 508 children were admitted 550 times with diagnoses consistent with acute lower respiratory tract infections. In the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, the crude incidence rate of pneumonia requiring hospital admission was 4.94 per 1,000 person-years, which decreased to 4.18 per 1,000 in the vaccine eligible cohorts. The analogous crude incidence rate of hospitalizations for acute lower respiratory tract infections was 2.94 and 5.23 per 1,00 person-years. Though the absolute number of admissions was similar between these two groups, the distribution of cases was different. The crude incidence rate of hospital admissions for pneumonia was highest in children 12-17 months of age, while the incidence rate of hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract infections was highest in children &lt;6 months of age (Figure 5.20). Children admitted for acute lower respiratory tract infections were significantly younger than children admitted for pneumonia (mean age 8.0 months and 13.6 months respectively, P&lt;.001). Using crude age-group stratified incidence rate ratios between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts, the incidence rate of pneumonia hospitalizations was found to have decreased significantly only among children 12-17 months of age, crude incidence rate ratio 0.52 (95%CI: 0.35-0.77). Using the same method, the incidence rate of hospital admissions for acute lower respiratory tract infections admissions was found to have increased significantly among children 0-5 months of age, crude incidence rate ratio 1.50 (95%CI 1.23-1.84). Figure 5.20: Incidence of hospitalization per 1,000 person-years by age- and disease-group A significant difference was detected in the cumulative rate of hospital admissions for both pneumonia and acute lower respiratory tract infections between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts (Figure 5.21). The hazard ratio of hospital admission for pneumonia was 0.80 (95%CI:0.67-0.95), with an E-value of 1.81 and a lower bound of 1.29. When the risk-set was restricted to children younger than 90 days and 90 days and older, respectively, the hazard ratio was 1.22 (95%CI 0.81-1.85) and 0.73 (95%CI 0.60-0.89) respectively. The hazard ratio for hospital admission due to acute lower respiratory tract infection was 1.32 (95%CI:1.14-1.53), with an E-value of 1.97 and a lower bound of 1.54. The hazard ratio was augmented when children younger than 90 days were analysed separately, HR 1.54 (95%CI 1.23-1.94). It was not significant in children 90 days and older, HR 1.18 (95%CI 0.97-1.44). A total of 131 hospitalizations for acute upper respiratory tract infections were recorded for 123 children. During the same period, 256 children were admitted to hospital 280 times for otitis media and complications. The crude incidence rate of hospital admissions for otitis media was higher than the incidence rate of admissions for acute upper respiratory tract infections; 2.32 and 1.45 per 1,000 person-years in the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible cohortsrespectively, compared to 0.78 and 1.13 per 1,000 person-years. The mean age of children admitted for acute upper respiratory tract infections was 13.5 months compared to 12.8 months for children admitted for otitis media and complications. The crude incidence rate by age-group is shown in Figure 5.20. The cumulative incidence rate of hospitalization per 1000 person-years for acute upper respiratory tract infections and otitis media and complications are shown in Figure 5.21. The hazard ratio of otitis media hospitalizations between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts was 0.57 (95%CI:0.43-0.73) with an E-value of 2.9 .and a lower bound of 2.08. When restricted to children younger than 90 days of age, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.33-1.57), and when evaluating children 90 days and older it was 0.55 (95%CI 0.42-0.72). The hazard ratio for hospital admission for acute upper respiratory tract infections was 1.56 (95%CI:1.11-2.19), with an E-value of 2.49 and a lower bound of 1.46. Among children younger than 90 days, and 90 days and older respectively, the hazard ratio was 3.4 (95%CI 1.72-6.90) and 1.13 (95%CI 0.75-1.71). Figure 5.21: Cumulative incidence of hospitalization per 1,000 children by disease-group A total of 15 children were admitted to hospital 19 times for meningitis, and 61 children were admitted 63 times for sepsis. The crude incidence rate of meningitis hospitalization was 16.5 and 8.7 per 100,000 person-years in the vaccine non-eligible and vaccine eligible cohorts respectively, and the analogous crude incidence rate for sepsis hospitalizations was 38.8 and 52.3. Culture confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease was diagnosed in 37 children under three years of age in the study birth-cohorts. Of those, 23 (59%) were admitted for inpatient treatment. Of the admitted children, eight children had a primary discharge diagnosis of Sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (A40.3), eight were diagnosed with Pneumococcal meningitis (G00.1), two with Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (J13), two with Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) and the remaining three were diagnosed with Bacterial meningitis, unspecified (G00.9), Pyogenic arthritis, unspecified (M00.9) and Fever, unspecified (R50.9). The crude incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, regardless of whether the child was admitted to hospital, was 24.7 per 100,000 person-years in the VNEC compared to 1.74 per 100,000 person-years in the VEC. When only considering hospitalized invasive pneumococcal disease, the crude IR was 24.7 and 1.74 per 100,000 person-years. No vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease was diagnosed in the VEC. Crude incidence rates of hospitalization by age-group are shown in Figure 5.20. Table 5.21: Hazard ratios between the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts for each disease-group Disease group Hazard ratio (95%CI) Otitis Media and Complications 0.56 (0.437-0.73) Acute upper respiratory infection 1.55 (1.103-2.18) Pneumonia 0.80 (0.671-0.95) Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Infections 1.32 (1.137-1.53) Sepsis 1.26 (0.744-2.12) Invasive Pneumococcal Disease 0.07 (0.009-0.50) The mean age of children admitted for meningitis, sepsis and invasive pneumococcal disease was 9.7 months, 8.4 months and 14.4 months respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of hospitalization per 1000 person-years for sepsis and invasive pneumococcal disease are depicted in Figure 5.21. The hazard ratio of hospitalization for meningitis between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts was 0.45 (95%CI 0.15-1.41). An E-value was not computed as the hazard ratio was not significant. The hazard ratio for hospital admissions due to invasive pneumococcal disease between the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible cohorts was 0.07 (95%CI:0.01-0.50), with an E-value of 28.06. and a lower bound of 3.41. The hazard ratio of a sepsis hospitalization between the vaccine eligibility cohorts was 1.26 (95%CI:0.75-2.13). No E-value was calculated as the ratio was not significant. Restricted analyses in these three diagnostic groups did not alter results significantly. "],

Over 90% of all children in the vaccine eligible birth-cohorts received all three doses before 24 months of age. Prior to the introduction of the vaccination program, few children were vaccinated against pneumococcus and even fewer had received two or more doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. An impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction was detected on several different facets of otitis media incidence. Pediatric primary care visits due to acute otitis media decreased by 21% and emergency department visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland decreased by 12-21%. Hospital based treatment of otitis media with parenteral ceftriaxone decreased by 42%. The incidence of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions decreased by 8% following the introduction of PHiD-CV10. The cumulative incidence of antimicrobial prescription among Icelandic children was high. Among children in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, the incidence of antimicrobial prescriptions was 165 prescriptions per 100 person-years and over 88% of had filled at least one prescription before their fourth birthday. The incidence of tympanostomy tube placements did not decrease following the introduction of PHiD-CV10, despite a measurable impact on otitis media visits to primary care and pediatric emergency departments and antimicrobial prescriptions. Approximately one-third of all Icelandic children undergo at least one tympanostomy tube procedure before five years of age. Pediatric hospital admissions for pneumonia declined by 20% following PHiD-CV10 introduction. This happened within the context of a large increase in bronchiolitis cases in young children. Pneumonia hospitalizations declined among Icelanders 20-39 years of age, implying a strong herd-effect among adults likely to by the parents of young children. Invasive pneumococcal disease requiring hospitalization decreased by 93% in the vaccine eligible cohorts compared to the vaccine non-eligible cohorts. No vaccine-type invasive disease was detected among the vaccinated cohorts. The pediatric pneumococcal vaccination program was cost-effective and was associated with a direct net-savings of 2,000,000,000 ISK. 6.2 Data collection and sources The data used for the papers in this thesis were collected from several population based registries. Each record was associated with a unique study identification number that was created from the individual’s national identification number by staff at the Icelandic Directorate of Health. This allowed the data from the various registries to be reliably linked. The linkage between several large population based registries overcame a common limitation of epidemiological data. Registries record information about an event that occurred, e.g. an antimicrobial prescription, a primary care visit or a hospital admission. Because of this, they generally lack information about those individuals who did not experience the event. Epidemiological studies are therefore often forced to infer the number of individuals who did not experience an event, and the denominator for the total number of individuals at-risk – individual level data on those who did not experience the event is missing. Our data included the date of birth, date of death, as well as data on immigration and emigration of Icelandic children. Through linkage of the registries, individual level information of those who did not experience an event became available, and accurate time-based at-risk denominators could be constructed. This allowed the study data to be analysed using survival methods, and repeated events within the same individual taken into account. The study contains individual level information on 375,383 Icelandic citizens from 2005-2017. According to Statistics Iceland, the aggregate number of Icelandic citizens was 293,577 on the 1 January 2005, and 338,349 on the 1 January 2017. Primary care and hospital visits associated with the study’s ICD-10 diagnoses are discussed in more detail in the sub-chapters pertaining to the impact of PHiD-CV10. However, it is interesting to note the distribution of visits compared to hospitalizations. Children zero to five years of age are responsible for the vast majority of primary care and emergency department visits due to respiratory infections. However, adults 55 and older are responsible for a disproportionate number of hospitalizations (Figure 5.1). discuss the vaccine registry, how no difference is occurring in pneumococcal vaccinations of adults discuss how the 2009 and 2010 cohorts received vaccination late, almost like a catch-up. 6.3 Epidemiology and impact of PHiD-CV10 on otitis media in Iceland (Papers I, II, III, V and VI) Following the introduction of PHiD-CV10, changes were noted in several facets of otitis media epidemiology. These changes were summarized in papers I, II, III, V and VI. 6.3.1 Epidemiology of acute otitis media in Iceland (Papers II and V) Acute otitis media is a common childhood disease. Its psychopathology and microbiology are discussed in chapter 2.1.1. The epidemiology of acute otitis media visits to primary care was described in paper II. During the study period, the overall incidence of acute otitis media episodes among children zero to three years of age was 42 per 100 person-years. There was a large variation in the incidence rate between both gender, birth-cohort and age. The incidence was consistently higher in males than females, and was highest among children 8-11 and 12-15 months of age. The incidence of acute otitis media is highly variable between countries. In 2010, a multicenter study in Europe estimated the incidence rate among children under three years of age to be 31 per 100 person-years in Germany, 19 per 100 person-years in Italy, 39 per 100 person-years in Spain, 34 per 100 person-years in Sweden and 25 per 100 person-years in the United Kingdom (Liese et al. 2014). Another study reported an incidence of 47 cases per 100 person-years in Sweden, prior to the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (Gisselsson-Solen 2017). The highest published estimates of acute otitis media incidence come from the United States of America. From 2001-2011 the incidence rate was reported to be 80-125 episodes per 100 person-years (Marom et al. 2014). This places Iceland above most European countries in the incidence of otitis media, but below the United States of America. The variability described is likely due to many different factors. Acute otitis media is often a benign, self-limiting condition. The propensity to seek medical care may be influenced by several different cultural and socio-economic factors. Access and cost of healthcare may influence whether parents seek care for their child and may result in measurable changes in incidence between countries (Hadley 2003; Smolderen 2010). In Iceland, all permanent residents are provided health insurance by the government and there is excellent access to urgent care. Children are provided healthcare free of charge. In Iceland, both parents are typically fully employed and the proportion of children attending daycare is high. These factors may push parents to seek early care for otitis media. The employment rate of Icelandic adults 20-64 years of age is 91% and 84% for males and females respectively, which means that Iceland has the highest employment rate in Europe (Eurostat 2018). Iceland is ranked third in formal daycare attendance by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with up to 60% of children under three years of age attending 38 hours per week or longer. This is compared to the OECD average of 35% attendance for 30 hours (co-operation and development 2013). Both daycare attendance and the number of hours per week are known risk factors for acute otitis media (Ramakrishnan, Sparks, and Berryhill 2007) These factors should result in a higher incidence of Iceland relative to other countries. However, certain factors in the study design are likely to decrease the observed incidence. A previous study in Iceland estimated the incidence of acute otitis media using a parental questionnaire and found the incidence rate to be 55-80 episodes per 100 person-years (Gudnason et al. 2013) This suggests that not all otitis media cases are being brought to primary care physicians, and are therefore not counted in our study. Of those episodes of acute otitis media that present for physician consultation, some may be missed in our study due to not having access data regarding visits to specialists. Additionally, many of the studies being compared to use the number of acute otitis media visits as the numerator, and therefore count visits for re-evaluations of the same otitis media episode. Our study excludes visits within 30 days of the index visit to better approximate the number of acute otitis media episodes resulting in physician consultation. 6.3.2 Impact on primary care visits for otitis media (Papers II and VI) Two separate population based studies estimated the impact of PHiD-CV10 on otitis media visits in primary care. The studies used different methods and complemented each other with regards to underlying assumptions, weaknesses and strengths. In paper II, the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction was estimated as 1 - hazard ratio of otitis media visits between children in the last vaccine non-eligible cohort and last vaccine eligible cohort. The hazard ratio was obtained from an Andersen-Gill regression model that incorporated individual level information on otitis media visits. Correlation between successive visits of the same child were accounted for using sandwich variance estimates. This approach allowed for accurate estimation of an individual child’s hazard of otitis media and accounted for differences in follow-up time. It accurately corrected for the effect of age, as age was the underlying time frame of the model. The estimated vaccine impact using this model was 21%. The vaccine impact was shown to protect against a child’s first and second visit. One criticism of this approach is that it does not account for trends in time. In Figure 5.9, there is a suggestion of a slight decreasing trend in the hazard of acute otitis media, among children in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts. Accounting for this is unlikely to affect the overall results, but may change the study’s point-estimate. In paper VI, a time-series methodology was used to emphasize correction for secular trends. A synthetic control framework was used, in which the relationship between otitis media visits and visits for other indications was estimated in the pre-vaccine period, and this relationship was used to predict the number of otitis media visits which would have occurred in the post-vaccine period, had PHiD-CV10 not been introduced. This approach accurately accounts for secular trends, and gives a robust estimate of the vaccine impact. It also allows estimation of herd-effect in older children who were not vaccine eligible in the post-vaccine period. However, unlike the individual based Andersen-Gill model, it is run on aggregate monthly data and is run separately for each age-group which cannot be more granular than one year intervals. The vaccine impact is estimated as 1 - rate ratio between the observed number of otitis media visits and the predicted number of otitis media visits. The vaccine impact was 18% among children younger than one year of age, 10% among one year olds, 9% among two year olds and 14% among children three to four years of age. Despite the different methodologies, the results of paper II and paper VI are consistent. The point-estimated in both papers are similar and the diminishing vaccine impact seen in older children with the time-series methodology is mirrored in the incidence rate ratios between the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts displayed in Figure 5.8. 6.3.2.0.0.0.0.0.0.1 Paragraph comparing our results to the results of others In any vaccine ecology study, one must be careful interpreting the observed effects, as confounding may have contributed to over- or underestimation of the estimated vaccine impact. The impact of PHiD-CV10 on acute otitis media in Iceland is quantified using two different methods that complement one another. Both are informed by population based data on all otitis media visits to the primary care system in Iceland. A visit is defined to be associated with otitis media, based on the diagnostic codes that were recorded during the visit. The same diagnostic coding system, ICD-10, has been in use in Iceland during the entire study period and clinical information has been documented in the same elctronic health record software, Saga. There does not seem to be any reason to suspect that a systematic drift has occurred in the diagnostic classification of children presenting to primary care physicians during the study period that could confound the observed vaccine impact. To the authors’ knowledge, no change in a child’s access to urgent care within the primary care system has occurred during the study period. However, access to specialist paediatricians at private clinics has increased from 42,916 visits in 2005 to 58,048 visits in 2016 (www.statice.is). These visits were not accessible to the study’s authors and not included in the study’s data. This could be considered a confounder to the observed vaccine impact in paper II, as some of the observed decrease in otitis media cases could hypothetically be explained by children increaseingly seeking care outside the primary care system. This is unlikely, as urgent care provided by paediatricians has not increased during the study period, only appointments (personal correspondence with the head of the only private pediatrician clinic in Iceland providing urgent care). Even if urgent care visits had been diverted from primary care to private practice pediatricians, this would not confound the estimates of paper VI, unless children presenting with otitis media were preferentially diverted compared to children presenting with other diagnoses. There is nothing to suggest this. 6.3.3 Impact on pediatric emergency department visits for acute otitis media (Paper I) On average, emergency department visits for acute otitis media are likely to represent a subset of more serious cases than those that present to primary care centers. Paper I examined the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction on the incidence of acute otitis media visits to the emergency department of Children’s Hospital Iceland. Following vaccine introduction, the incidence decreased significantly from 4.7 visits per 100 person-years in the pre-vaccine period to to 4.1 visits per 100 person-years in the post-vaccine period. The estimated vaccine impact was 12%. 6.3.3.0.0.0.0.0.0.1 Paragraph comparing our results to the results of others This study employed a simple pre/post design, and was not able to adjust for secular trends due to the nature of the study data. The estimation of the incidence of acute otitis media visits, and impact of the introduction of PHiD-CV10 was a secondary objective. A robust time-series approach with synthetic controls is warranted to further investigate the impact of PHiD-CV10 on pediatric emergency department visits for acute otitis media. 6.3.4 Impact on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions for otitis media (Paper III) 6.3.5 Impact on acute otitis media with treatment failure (Paper I) There exists a paucity of published studies that examine the impact of PHiD-CV10 on acute otitis media with treatment failure. Treatment failure is defined as the persistance of symptoms despite antimicrobial treatment. There is evidence to suggest that treatment failure occurs more commonly in acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilius influenzae than other pathogens (Casey and Pichichero 2004; Pichichero et al. 2008) Otitis media with treatment failure represents an important subset of otitis media cases that is associated with a higher burden of disease. In paper I, the impact of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of acute otitis media episodes treated with parenteral ceftriaxone at Children’s Hospital Iceland was examined. The study demonstrated a statistically significant 42% vaccine impact. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a significant decrease in acute otitis media with treatment failure following introduction of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Because acute otitis media with treatment failure is not consistantly defined in the literature, a proxy measurement such as ceftriaxone use is needed. Parenteral antimicrobial use is avoided unless absolutely necessary and is not administered at primary care clinics. It is therefore an appropriate and clinically relevant proxy measurement for the worst cases of otitis media with treatment failure. Another Proportion of PNSP decreased following vaccine introduction. However, these rates are also influenced by the rate at which physicians take samples for culture, which has been decreasing year by year from 2007 in Iceland. Our study mitigates such bias by measuring the treatment of AOM with treatment failure, most often due to resistant infections. There is therefore stron The data suggests that this reduction is due to the effect of vaccination and is associated with a decrease in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcus. Before the introduction of PHiD-CV10 the proportion of PNSP isolates from middle ear was 48.7% of which 97.2% were serotypes covered by the vaccine20. Previous studies have shown a decrease in resistant clones of pneumococci following introduction of PCV18,19. This is mirrored in resistance rates published by the national reference laboratory, at the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital. Of all pneumococcal isolates collected in 2015 only 22% were PNSP21. Because this is a retrospective observational study, causation between vaccine introduction and the observed decrease in AOM visits and ceftriaxone use cannot be directly inferred. However, this conclusion is supported by several observations. Ceftriaxone use decreased only for indications that would be expected if associated with the introduction of PHiD-CV10. We show that there was a significant decrease in the use of ceftriaxone to treat AOM and pneumonia in children 0-3 years of age. We did not observe a similar significant decrease in ceftriaxone use for other diagnoses, although there was a trend towards decrease. Ceftriaxone is the empiric treatment of choice for septic infants in The Children’s Hospital Iceland. Therefore, the observed decrease in ceftriaxone use for other diagnoses may represent a decrease in the number of children with symptoms of sepsis who visit The Children’s Hospital. No changes in institutional guidelines regarding the treatment of AOM with treatment failure or use of ceftriaxone were introduced during the study period. We tested whether significant change had occurred in ceftriaxone use by age group and found a significant decrease only in the youngest children 0-3 years of age. The rate of ceftriaxone use regardless of indication remained unchanged in children 4-7, 8-11 and 12-17 years of age. This supports the hypothesis that the observed decrease is associated with PHiD-CV10, and is not due to an independent shift in hospital practices. The Children’s Hospital is Iceland’s only pediatric referral hospital and also functions as a walk-in clinic for the capital area. To our knowledge, no change in guidelines or practices regarding referrals to The Children’s Hospital occurred that could explain the observed decrease in AOM visits and ceftriaxone treatment. Even if this was the case, increased outpatient treatment of pediatric disease would likely cause an overall decrease in visits to The Children’s Hospital and a higher proportion of complex cases. This would be expected to cause an increase in the relative use of ceftriaxone for AOM. In contrast, we show that there has been a steady increase in the total number of visits to The Children’s Hospital over the study period, but both an absolute and relative decrease in the number of visits for AOM. Similar findings have previously been published by our research group22.The observed reduction in ceftriaxone use for AOM remains significant after correcting for an observed decrease in AOM visits. Drug administration at The Children’s Hospital was systematically documented with standardized procedural codes that did not change during the study period. This enabled us to retrieve exact data on AOM and ceftriaxone treatment on all individuals. The observation that ceftriaxone use for other indications did not change significantly between vaccine periods is consistent with our expectations, as ceftriaxone remains the empirical treatment of choice for severe infections at the Children’s Hospital. 6.3.6 Impact on hospital admissions for otitis media (Paper V) 6.3.7 Evidence of herd-effect of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of otitis media in the unvaccinated population (Papers II and VI) Vaccination decreases the susceptibility of vaccinated individuals to become infected, and later pass the pathogen to others. Therefore, there is a strong theoretical reason to believe that introducing PHiD-CV10 into the population could confer indirect protection against pneumococcal disease to non-vaccinated members of the population. In vaccine studies, this indirect effect is termed herd-effect, and has been convincingly demonstrated for invasive pneumococcal disease following introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. There is a paucity of published literature demonstrating herd-effect against acute otitis media following pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction (Loo et al. 2014). In paper II, a large decrease in the incidence of acute otitis media was found among children under four months of age. The incidence rate ratio between children in the vaccine eligible cohorts compared to children in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts was 0.60 (0.51-0.69), which translates to a 40% vaccine impact in this age-group. Children three to four months of age may have already received the first dose of PHiD-CV10, but will not yet have received any direct benefit (Nicholls, Leach, and Morris 2016). Thus the data strongly supports existence of a herd-effect for otitis media, and that vaccinating children at three, five and 12 months of age with PHiD-CV10 confers protection to children too young to be themselves directly protected. One previous study reported fewer positive pneumococcal cultures from samples taken from the middle ear of children younger than four months of age, following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Isreal, suggesting a possible herd-effect (Ben-Shimol et al. 2016). In Paper VI, a time-series methodology with synthetic controls was applied to ascertain the PHiD-CV10 impact on otitis media visits in primary care. The study period was 2005-2015, during which none of the vaccine eligible children had reached five years of age. The vaccine impact was estimated separately in children younger than one, one, two, three to four, five to nine, 10-14 and 15-19 years of age. Among children five to nine years of age, the estimated vaccine impact was 11%, and was 17% in children 10-14 years of age. A statistically non-significant impact of 15% was noted among children 15-19 years of age. This is consistent with a strong herd-effect of PHiD-CV10 against otitis media in unvaccinated older children. 6.4 Impact of PHiD-CV10 on tympanostomy tube placements (Paper IV) 6.5 Impact of PHiD-CV10 on pneumonia in Iceland (Papers V and VI) 6.5.1 Impact on pneumonia hospitalizations (Papers V and VI) 6.5.2 Evidence of herd-effect of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of pneumonia hospitalization in the unvaccinated population (Papers V and VI) 6.6 Impact of PHiD-CV10 on invasive pneumococcal disease (Papers V and VI) 6.7 Cost-effectiveness of introduction of PHiD-CV10 into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program (Paper VI) References "],
