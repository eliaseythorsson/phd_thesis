<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Main findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The pediatric pneumococcal vaccination program that was implemented in Iceland in 2011 achieved excellent coverage. Over 90% of all children in the vaccine eligible birth-cohorts received all three doses before 24 months of age. Prior to the introduction of the vaccination program, few children were vaccinated against pneumococcus and even fewer had received two or more doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.</p></li>
<li><p>An impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction was detected on several different facets of otitis media incidence. Pediatric primary care visits due to acute otitis media decreased by 21% and emergency department visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland decreased by 12-21%. Hospital based treatment of otitis media with parenteral ceftriaxone decreased by 42%.</p></li>
<li><p>The incidence of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions decreased by 8% following the introduction of PHiD-CV10. The cumulative incidence of antimicrobial prescription among Icelandic children was high. Among children in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, the incidence of antimicrobial prescriptions was 165 prescriptions per 100 person-years and over 88% of had filled at least one prescription before their fourth birthday.</p></li>
<li><p>The incidence of tympanostomy tube placements did not decrease following the introduction of PHiD-CV10, despite a measurable impact on otitis media visits to primary care and pediatric emergency departments and antimicrobial prescriptions. Approximately one-third of all Icelandic children undergo at least one tympanostomy tube procedure before five years of age.</p></li>
<li><p>Pediatric hospital admissions for pneumonia declined by 20% following PHiD-CV10 introduction. This happened within the context of a large increase in bronchiolitis cases in young children. Pneumonia hospitalizations declined among Icelanders 20-39 years of age, implying a strong herd-effect among adults likely to by the parents of young children.</p></li>
<li><p>Invasive pneumococcal disease requiring hospitalization decreased by 93% in the vaccine eligible cohorts compared to the vaccine non-eligible cohorts. No vaccine-type invasive disease was detected among the vaccinated cohorts.</p></li>
<li><p>The pediatric pneumococcal vaccination program was cost-effective and was associated with a direct net-savings of 2,000,000,000 ISK.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Data collection and sources</h2>
<p>The data used for the papers in this thesis were collected from several population based registries. Each record was associated with a unique study identification number that was created from the individual’s national identification number by staff at the Icelandic Directorate of Health. This allowed the data from the various registries to be reliably linked.</p>
<p>The linkage between several large population based registries overcame a common limitation of epidemiological data. Registries record information about an event that occurred, e.g. an antimicrobial prescription, a primary care visit or a hospital admission. Because of this, they generally lack information about those individuals who did not experience the event. Epidemiological studies are therefore often forced to either restrict their scope to individuals who experienced one or more events, or infer the number of individuals who did not experience an event and the denominator for the total number of individuals at-risk – individual level data on those who did not experience the event is missing.</p>
<p>Our data included the date of birth, date of death, as well as data on immigration and emigration of Icelandic children. Through linkage of the registries, individual level information of those who did not experience an event became available, and accurate time-based at-risk denominators could be constructed. This allowed the study data to be analysed using survival methods, and repeated events within the same individual taken into account. The study contains individual level information on 375,383 Icelandic citizens over a 13 year period from 2005-2017. According to Statistics Iceland, the aggregate number of Icelandic citizens was 293,577 on 1 January 2005, and was 338,349 on 1 January 2017.</p>
<p>Individual level information was available for each pneumococcal vaccine dose that was administered in Iceland. Unlike prior studies, which were forced to infer the the proportion of individuals who were vaccinated using aggregate sales data, we were able to directly check if a specific individual was vaccinated. We were also able to ascertain the low proportion of individuals who were vaccinated prior to the introduction of PHiD-CV10 into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program. The exception to this was the slight increase in uptake in the 2010 birth-cohort, especially those children born in the later half of 2010. This is likely due to heightened awareness among parents because of the impending introduction of the vaccine. In some sense the result is that a unplanned catch-up occurred, with close to 40% of children born in the later half of 2010 receiving two or more doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, before two years of age.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Epidemiology of acute otitis media in Iceland (Papers II and V)</h3>
<p>The epidemiology of acute otitis media visits to primary care was described in <a href="methods.html#paper2">paper II</a>. During the 11 year study period from 2005 to 2015, the overall incidence of AOM episodes among children zero to three years of age was 42 per 100 person-years. Prior to the introduction of PCV into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program, 59% of children had visited a primary care physician one or more times by their third birthday and each child had experienced 1.6 episodes on average. There were large variations in the incidence rate between both gender, birth-cohort and age. The incidence was consistently higher in males than females, and was highest among children 8-11 and 12-15 months of age.</p>
<p>The pathophysiology and microbiology of AOM are discussed in chapter <a href="intro.html#acuteotitismediaintroduction">2.1.1</a>. The incidence of AOM is highly variable between countries. Published estimates of the incidence prior to the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are summarized in Table <a href="intro.html#tab:table-intro-aom-incidence">2.2</a>. Generally, the rate of AOM among European children ranges from 15 to 40 episodes per 100 person-years, while the rate among children in the United States ranges from 95 to 200 episodes per 100 person-years. The rate of AOM in Iceland seems to be higher than published estimates from most other European countries, but lower than published estimates from the United States. To our knowledge, only two previous studies have reported the cumulative incidence of AOM in a modern cohort, demonstrating a 74% and 60% cumulative incidence by five and seven years of age respectively <span class="citation">(Gribben et al. <a href="#ref-Gribben2012">2012</a>; Todberg et al. <a href="#ref-Todberg2014">2014</a>)</span>. Compare this to our estimate of 59% by four years of age, and to two studies from the twentieth century showing a 83% cumulative incidence by three years of age and 66% by two years of age <span class="citation">(Bjarnason, Friðriksson, and Benediktsson <a href="#ref-Bjarnason1991">1991</a>; Teele, Klein, and Rosner <a href="#ref-Teele1989">1989</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Care must be taken when comparing incidence rates from different countries, time-periods and age-groups, as variable estimates are not necessarily due to true difference in the rates of clinical disease. Acute otitis media is often a benign, self-limiting condition. The propensity to seek medical care may be influenced by several cultural and socio-economic factors. Access and cost of healthcare may influence whether parents consult a physician and may result in measurable changes in incidence between countries <span class="citation">(Fortanier et al. <a href="#ref-Fortanier2015">2015</a>; Hadley <a href="#ref-Hadley2003">2003</a>; Smolderen <a href="#ref-Smolderen2010">2010</a>)</span>. In Iceland, all permanent residents are provided health insurance by the government and there is excellent access to urgent care. Children are provided healthcare free of charge. In Iceland, both parents are typically fully employed and the proportion of children attending daycare is high. These factors may push parents to seek early care for otitis media. The employment rate of Icelandic adults 20-64 years of age is 91% and 84% for males and females respectively, which means that Iceland has the highest employment rate in Europe <span class="citation">(Eurostat <a href="#ref-Eurostat2018">2018</a>)</span>. Iceland is ranked third in formal daycare attendance by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with up to 60% of children under three years of age attending 38 hours per week or longer. This is compared to the OECD average of 35% attendance for 30 hours <span class="citation">(co-operation and development <a href="#ref-Organisationforeconomicco-operationanddevelopment2013">2013</a>)</span>.

<p>However, certain factors in the study design are likely to decrease the observed incidence.

Of those episodes of acute otitis media that present for physician consultation, not all present to a primary care physician. Our study may miss some cases, due to not having access data regarding visits to specialists. Additionally, many of the studies being compared to use the number of acute otitis media visits as the numerator, and therefore count visits for re-evaluations of the same otitis media episode. Our study excludes visits within 30 days of the index visit to better approximate the number of acute otitis media episodes resulting in physician consultation.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Impact on primary care visits for otitis media (Papers II and VI)</h3>
<p>Two separate population based studies estimated the impact of PHiD-CV10 on otitis media visits in primary care. The studies used different methods which complemented each other with regards to underlying assumptions, weaknesses and strengths.</p>
<p>In <a href="results.html#paper2results">paper II</a>, the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction was estimated as 1 - hazard ratio of AOM between children in the last vaccine non-eligible cohort and last vaccine eligible cohort. The hazard ratio was obtained from an Andersen-Gill regression model that incorporated individual level information on AOM episodes. Correlation between successive episodes of the same child were accounted for using sandwich variance estimates. This approach allowed for accurate estimation of an individual child’s hazard of AOM and accounted for differences in follow-up time between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts. The model accurately corrected for the effect of age, as age was the underlying time frame of the model. Using this model, the estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 was 21%. The vaccine impact was shown to independently protect against a child’s first and second episode, but in the subset of children who had already experienced two episodes of AOM, the vaccine was not shown to decrease the hazard of experiencing a third episode. The study adds to the current literature by providing robust individual level observational evidence of PCV impact on AOM. Randomized controlled trials have shown inconsistent results regarding the efficacy of PCV on all-cause AOM <span class="citation">(Black et al. <a href="#ref-Black2000">2000</a>; Dagan et al. <a href="#ref-Dagan2001">2001</a>; Eskola et al. <a href="#ref-Eskola2001">2001</a>; Fireman et al. <a href="#ref-Fireman2003">2003</a>; Kilpi et al. <a href="#ref-Kilpi2003">2003</a>; O’Brien et al. <a href="#ref-OBrien2008">2008</a>; Palmu et al. <a href="#ref-Palmu2015">2015</a>; Prymula et al. <a href="#ref-Prymula2006">2006</a>; Tregnaghi et al. <a href="#ref-Tregnaghi2014">2014</a>; Vesikari et al. <a href="#ref-Vesikari2016">2016</a>)</span>, and no population based study on the impact of PCV on AOM in primary care has previously been reported. To our knowledge, this was the first study to directly account for repeated episodes within the same individual and employ survival methods that accounted for confounding by age and censoring.</p>
<p>One criticism of the methods employed in paper II, is that they do not account for secular trends in the hazard of AOM prior to introduction of the vaccine. Visual inspection of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper2-hazard">5.10</a> suggests a slight decreasing trend in the hazard of AOM, with each successive vaccine non-eligible cohort. Accounting for this may slightly change the point-estimate. However, the large, abrupt decrease in the hazard ratio between the last vaccine non-eligible cohort and the first vaccine eligible cohort provides strong evidence of a true vaccine impact. Nevertheless, a time-series methodology was used to emphasize correction for secular trends in <a href="#paper6results">paper VI</a>. A synthetic control framework was used, in which the relationship between otitis media visits and visits for other indications was estimated in the pre-vaccine period, and this relationship was used to predict the number of otitis media visits which would have occurred in the post-vaccine period, had PHiD-CV10 not been introduced. This approach accurately accounts for secular trends, and gives a robust estimate of the vaccine impact. It also allows estimation of herd-effect in older children who were not vaccine eligible in the post-vaccine period. However, unlike the individual based Andersen-Gill model, it is run on aggregate monthly data and is run separately for each age-group which cannot be more granular than one year intervals. The vaccine impact is estimated as 1 - rate ratio between the observed number of otitis media visits and the predicted number of otitis media visits. The vaccine impact was 18% among children younger than one year of age, 10% among one year olds, 9% among two year olds and 14% among children three to four years of age. Only three previous observational studies evaluating the impact of PCV on otitis media have attempted to correct for secular trends <span class="citation">(Grijalva et al. <a href="#ref-Grijalva2006">2006</a>; Lau et al. <a href="#ref-Lau2015">2015</a>; Marom et al. <a href="#ref-Marom2014">2014</a>)</span>. Unlike those, the methods used in paper VI do not depend upon the assumption that pre-vaccine trends can only be linear and lower the risk of bias considerably by introducing controls.</p>
<p>In any vaccine ecology study, one must be careful when interpreting the results, as confounding may have contributed to over- or underestimation of the estimated vaccine impact. The impact of PHiD-CV10 on AOM in Iceland is quantified using two different methods that complement one another. Despite the different methodologies, the results of <a href="results.html#paper2results">paper II</a> and <a href="#paper6results">paper VI</a> are consistent. The point-estimated in both papers are similar and the diminishing vaccine impact seen in older children with the time-series methodology is mirrored in the incidence rate ratios between the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts displayed in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper2-incidence">5.9</a>. Both are informed by population based data on all otitis media visits to the primary care system in Iceland. A visit is defined to be associated with otitis media, based on the diagnostic codes that were recorded during the visit. The same diagnostic coding system, ICD-10, has been in use in Iceland during the entire study period and clinical information has been documented in the same electronic health record software, <em>Saga</em>. There does not seem to be any reason to suspect that a systematic drift has occurred in the diagnostic classification of children presenting to primary care physicians during the study period that could confound the observed vaccine impact.</p>
<p>To the authors’ knowledge, no change in a child’s access to urgent care within the primary care system has occurred during the study period. However, access to specialist pediatricians at private clinics has increased from 42,916 visits in 2005 to 58,048 visits in 2016 (www.statice.is). These visits were not accessible to the study’s authors and not included in the study’s data. This could be considered a confounder to the observed vaccine impact in <a href="methods.html#paper2">paper II</a>, as some of the observed decrease in otitis media cases could hypothetically be explained by children increasingly seeking care outside the primary care system. This is unlikely, as urgent care provided by pediatricians has not increased during the study period, only appointments (personal correspondence with the head of the only private pediatrician clinic in Iceland providing urgent care). Even if urgent care visits had been diverted from primary care to private practice pediatricians, this would not confound the estimates of <a href="methods.html#paper6">paper VI</a>, unless children presenting with otitis media were preferentially diverted compared to children presenting with other diagnoses. There is nothing to suggest this.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.3</span> Impact on pediatric emergency department visits for acute otitis media (Paper I)</h3>
<p>On average, emergency department visits for acute otitis media are likely to represent a subset of more serious cases than those that present to primary care centers. <a href="results.html#paper1results">Paper I</a> examined the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction on the incidence of acute otitis media visits to the emergency department of Children’s Hospital Iceland. Following vaccine introduction, the incidence decreased significantly from 4.7 visits per 100 person-years in the pre-vaccine period to to 4.1 visits per 100 person-years in the post-vaccine period. The estimated vaccine impact was 12%. This study employed a simple pre/post design, and was not able to adjust for secular trends due to the nature of the study data. The design was similar to most previously published observational studies of PCV on AOM <span class="citation">(Vojtek, Nordgren, and Hoet <a href="#ref-Vojtek2017">2017</a>)</span>. The estimation of the incidence of acute otitis media visits, and impact of the introduction of PHiD-CV10 was a secondary objective of the paper. A robust time-series approach with synthetic controls is warranted to further investigate the impact of PHiD-CV10 on pediatric emergency department visits for acute otitis media, as was done in paper VI for primary care.</p>

<div id="impact-on-outpatient-antimicrobial-prescriptions-for-otitis-media-paper-iii" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4</span> Impact on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions for otitis media (Paper III)</h3>
<p>The impact of the introduction of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions for AOM was explored in <a href="results.html#paper3results">Paper III</a>, using population based registries. Data was obtained from the Icelandic National Drug Prescription Registry which included all filled outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions during a thirteen year period from 2005 to 2017. This was linked to visits to primary care physicians for AOM which was extracted from the Primary Care Registry. The impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction into the pediatric vaccination program was defined as 1 - hazard ratio of AOM associated antimicrobial prescription between children in the last vaccine non-eligible cohort and last vaccine eligible cohort. The hazard ratio was obtained from an Andersen-Gill model, which corrected for age, gender, censored follow-up time and correlations between successive prescriptions of the same individual child. Using this definition, the estimated impact on AOM associated antimicrobial prescriptions was 22%.</p>
<p>Several randomized controlled trials have estimated the vaccine efficacy of PCV on outpatient antimicrobial consumption, with results ranging from 5% to 15% <span class="citation">(Dagan et al. <a href="#ref-Dagan2001">2001</a>; Fireman et al. <a href="#ref-Fireman2003">2003</a>; Palmu et al. <a href="#ref-Palmu2014">2014</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Dagan et al. (<a href="#ref-Dagan2001">2001</a>)</span> specifically examined efficacy against otitis media associated antimicrobial days, and reported 20% vaccine efficacy. Our results are within reasonable bounds of these findings. Though blinded randomized controlled trials do provide robust estimates of vaccine efficacy, they do so under artificial conditions. Parents and physicians may behave differently knowing that their actions are being observed and quantified by researchers, and this may reduce the incidence of inappropriate prescribing. In that respect, observational studies provide additional information by demonstrating whether vaccine impact can still be observed in true clinical settings. Only one study has previously assessed the impact of PCV on otitis media associated antimicrobial prescriptions, which demonstrated a 20% vaccine impact <span class="citation">(Lau et al. <a href="#ref-Lau2015">2015</a>)</span>. Two other observational studies on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions demonstrated an association between PCV introduction and a decline in prescriptions <span class="citation">(Gefenaite et al. <a href="#ref-Gefenaite2014">2014</a>; Howitz et al. <a href="#ref-Howitz2017">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Unlike previously published observational studies, we report the results of a cohort study using individual level data. This allows a much sharper delineation between vaccinated and unvaccinated children. When data is aggregated and analysed based on calendar-time, the period from the introduction of the vaccine until the majority of children under observation are vaccinated will span several years. During that time, other secular trends exert their confounding effects on the outcome, and the start of the post-vaccination period is not well defined. Contrast this to our cohort study were children in the 2010 cohort, who were not vaccine eligible, are directly compared to the vaccine eligible children in the 2011 cohort. Though the children in the 2010 birth-cohort are one year older on average, the two cohorts experience the same viral epidemics, are treated by the same physicians and interact with each other daily in daycare centers.</p>
<p>Ecological studies are subject to confounding which must be taken into account when the results are interpreted. A decreasing trend in the hazard of AOM associated antimicrobial prescriptions was noted in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, such that the hazard was significantly higher in the 2007 compared to the 2010 birth-cohort. Though this may change the point-estimate of the vaccine impact, the large, abrupt and significant hazard decrease in the 2011 compared to the 2010 cohort strongly suggests a true vaccine impact.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.5</span> Evidence of herd-effect of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of otitis media in the unvaccinated population (Papers II and VI)</h3>
<p>Vaccination decreases the susceptibility of vaccinated individuals to become infected, and later pass the pathogen to others. Therefore, there is a strong theoretical reason to believe that introducing PHiD-CV10 into the population could confer indirect protection against pneumococcal disease to non-vaccinated members of the population. In vaccine studies, this indirect effect is termed herd-effect, and has been convincingly demonstrated for invasive pneumococcal disease following introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. There is a paucity of published literature demonstrating herd-effect for acute otitis media following pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction <span class="citation">(Jennifer D Loo et al. <a href="#ref-Loo2014">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In <a href="results.html#paper2results">paper II</a>, a large decrease in the incidence of AOM was found among children under four months of age. The incidence rate ratio between children in the vaccine eligible cohorts compared to children in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts was 0.60 (0.51-0.69), which translates to a 40% vaccine impact in this age-group. Children three to four months of age may have already received the first dose of PHiD-CV10, but will not yet have received any direct benefit <span class="citation">(Nicholls, Leach, and Morris <a href="#ref-Nicholls2016">2016</a>)</span>. Thus the data strongly supports existence of a herd-effect for AOM, and that vaccinating children at three, five and 12 months of age with PHiD-CV10 confers protection to children too young to be themselves directly protected. One previous study reported fewer positive pneumococcal cultures from samples taken from the middle ear of children younger than four months of age, following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Israel, suggesting a possible herd-effect <span class="citation">(Ben-Shimol et al. <a href="#ref-Ben-Shimol2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In <a href="#paper6results">paper VI</a>, a time-series methodology with synthetic controls was applied to ascertain the PHiD-CV10 impact on otitis media visits in primary care. The study period was 2005-2015, during which none of the vaccine eligible children had reached five years of age. The vaccine impact was estimated separately in children younger than one, one, two, three to four, five to nine, 10-14 and 15-19 years of age. Among children five to nine years of age, the estimated vaccine impact was 11%, and was 17% in children 10-14 years of age. For these estimates the 95% credible intervals did not cross the ratio value of 0.92, which can be interpreted as a 0.975 probability that the true decrease in the risk ratio of outpatient AOM in these age-groups is larger than 0.92. The median posterior probability of vaccine impact among children 15-19 years of age was 15%, however the 95% credible intervals crossed the ratio value of one, which suggests that there is some probability that the risk has increased. The result is consistent with a strong herd-effect of PHiD-CV10 against otitis media in unvaccinated older children.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.6</span> Impact on acute otitis media with treatment failure (Paper I)</h3>
<p>There is a paucity of published studies that examine the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on acute otitis media with treatment failure. Treatment failure is defined as the persistence of symptoms despite antimicrobial treatment. There is evidence to suggest that treatment failure occurs more commonly in AOM caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilius influenzae</em> than in AOM caused by other pathogens <span class="citation">(Casey and Pichichero <a href="#ref-Casey2004">2004</a>; Pichichero et al. <a href="#ref-Pichichero2008">2008</a>)</span> Otitis media with treatment failure represents an important subset of cases that is associated with a higher burden of disease. In <a href="results.html#paper1results">paper I</a>, the impact of PHiD-CV10 on the incidence of AOM episodes treated with parenteral ceftriaxone at Children’s Hospital Iceland was examined. Data regarding the use of ceftriaxone and visits for AOM were extracted from Children’s Hospital Iceland’s patient registry for the period from 2008 to 2015.<br />
The study demonstrated a statistically significant 52% impact of PHiD-CV10 on ceftriaxone treated AOM episodes among children younger than four years of age.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a significant decrease in AOM with treatment failure following PCV introduction. Because AOM with treatment failure is not objectively defined in the literature, a proxy measurement such as ceftriaxone use is needed. Parenteral antimicrobial use is avoided unless absolutely necessary and is not administered at primary care clinics. It is therefore an appropriate and clinically relevant proxy measurement for the worst cases of otitis media with treatment failure. We do however acknowledge that we are not currently in possession of data that proves that a trial of oral antimicrobials was attempted prior to initiation of parenteral ceftriaxone. It is an assumption that is grounded in established clinical norms of pediatric medicine. Unlike the other study data upon which this thesis is based, the data used in paper I was not linkable to population registries, which precludes formal evaluation of this assumption.</p>
<p>No changes in institutional guidelines regarding the use of ceftriaxone or treatment of severe AOM occurred during the study period. Several additional evaluations were performed to examine other possible explanations for the observed decrease. To exclude the possibility that the observed reduction was due to a decrease in AOM cases, the analysis was repeated using the number of AOM visits to Children’s Hospital Iceland as the rate denominator, If this statistic were used, the estimated vaccine impact would be 42%. No changes were observed in ceftriaxone usage among older children, and among children younger than four, ceftriaxone use for indications other than AOM and pneumonia did not change significantly, with an estimated incidence rate ratio 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87-1.06). Though not statistically significant, the observed rate ratio does not prove an absence of effect. The result is consistent with as much as a 13% decrease in the incidence of ceftriaxone treatment for indications other than AOM and pneumonia. This may be partly explained by the inclusion of indications other than AOM and pneumonia that are possibly related to PCV, such as unspecified fever, cough and sepsis. However, when the totality of evidence is considered, it suggests a true independent association between the introduction of PHiD-CV10 into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program, and the observed decrease in AOM treated with parenteral ceftriaxone. Clinical experience tells us that this may be considered a proxy for AOM with treatment failure.</p>

In <a href="results.html#paper4results">paper IV</a>, we report the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program on tympanostomy tube placements. This population based study obtained data on tympanostomy procedures from the reimbursement database of Icelandic Health Insurance and Landspitali University Hospital’s patient registry. Eleven consecutive birth-cohorts were followed from birth until five years of age, or end of the study’s observational period in 2016. A Cox regression model was used to compare the hazard ratio of tympaonstomy tube placement between each birth-cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort, and the vaccine impact was a priori defined as 1 - hazard ratio between the last included vaccine eligible cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort. This definition resulted in an estimated -5% (95%CI -15% to 4%) vaccine impact, indicating a non-significant increase in the hazard of tympanostomy tube placement following vaccine introduction.</p>

<p>We report an incidence of 106 procedures per 1,000 person-years in children zero to five years of age, and a cumulative incidence of 32% by six years of age. This represents both the highest cumulative incidence and incidence rate of tympanostomy procedures that has been published to date (Table <a href="intro.html#tab:table-intro-tympanostomy-incidence">2.3</a>). We demonstrate that among children who underwent tympanostomy tube placement, the proportion of children who had never visited a primary care physician or filled an antimicrobial prescription prior to the procedure was higher in the vaccine eligible cohorts. The study design does not allow us to estimate the cause of this unexpected increase. We cannot exclude the possibility that an increasing secular trend was occurring in the pre-vaccine period, and that the incidence would have been higher, had the vaccine not been introduced.</p>

The study included eleven consecutive birth-cohorts 2005-2015 and followed children from birth until their third birthday or to the end of the study’s observational period. Hospital admissions for otitis media were compared between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible birth-cohorts using a Cox regression model, resulting in a statistically significant 43% estimated vaccine impact. However, this difference seemed to be largely driven by a sharp decrease in the incidence of otitis media associated hospitalization between the first two vaccine non-eligible cohorts.

No attempt was made to correct for secular trends and the possibility was not discussed, which is understandable as the study did not include a single observational year prior to the introduction of PCV7 in 2000.

<p>Children’s Hospital Iceland is the only pediatric hospital in Iceland. It serves as a tertiary hospital for the entire population. <a href="results.html#paper5results">Paper V</a> reported the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction on pneumonia hospitalizations among children younger than three years of age. Eleven consecutive birth-cohorts 2005-2015 were followed from birth to three years of age or end of the study period in 2017. All hospitalizations with discharge diagnoses compatible with pneumonia were extracted from the patient registry. A Cox regression analysis was employed to estimate vaccine impact, which was defined as 1 - hazard ratio of pneumonia hospitalization between children in the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible cohorts. The model accurately corrected for the effect of age, as age was the underlying time frame of the model. Using this model, the estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 was 20%.</p>

<p>In <a href="#paper6results">paper VI</a>, a time-series methodology incorporating synthetic controls was used to estimate the impact of PHiD-CV10 introduction on pneumonia hospitalizations correcting for secular trends in the pre-vaccine period. Data on hospital admissions were extracted from Landspitali University’s Hospital patient registry. The relationship between pneumonia hospitalizations and hospital admissions for other diagnoses was estimated in the pre-vaccine period. On the basis of this relationship, the model predicted the number of pneumonia hospitalizations that would have occurred in the post-vaccine period, had the vaccine not been introduced. The difference between the observed rate of pneumonia hospitalizations and the model estimate was assumed to be due to the vaccine introduction. This approach accurately accounts for secular trends, and gives a robust estimate of the vaccine impact. It also allows for estimation of herd-effect in unvaccinated members of the population.</p>
