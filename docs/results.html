<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Data collection and sources</h2>
<p>The data presented in this thesis span a period from 2005-2017 and were collected and analysed over a four year period from 2013-2017.
Consequently, the papers that form this thesis were written and published at different times.
For this reason, the study period and the populations described in each paper varies slightly.
However, they differ only marginally from the final data summary described below.
The results of papers I-VI are summarized in their respective sub-chapters.</p>
<p>When data from all registries were taken together, individual-level information was available for 375,383 Icelandic citizens, of which 183,544 were female and 181,316 were male.
Gender was not registered for 10,523 individuals.
The exact date of birth was available for 366,188, and birth-year for the rest.
The median birth-year for the whole study population was 1979 (IQR 1958-1997).
Death was registered for 12,308 individuals.</p>
<p>The study often examined data stratified by birth-cohort.
The number of children in each birth-cohort who contributed data to the present study is shown in Table <a href="results.html#tab:table-cohort-results">4.1</a>.</p>
<table>
<caption><span id="tab:table-cohort-results">Table 4.1: </span>Demographic information regarding birth-cohorts included in the study. The number of children and proportion who are male is presented. The number of children in each cohort who had registered immigration or emigration from Iceland before four years of age is shown.</caption>

<p>Statistics Iceland (www.statice.is) provided data on the immigration and emigration of all Icelandic children zero to four years of age from 2005-2017.
Of the 57,695 Icelandic children born 2005 or later, 5,577 moved to or from the country 6,847 times.
The proportion of children in each birth-cohort who moved at least once before five years of age, was consistently 9%-12% of those birth-cohorts who had full five year follow-up time with regards to immigration and emigration (birth-cohorts 2005-2012).</p>

<p>Thus the study found significant decreases in the incidence of AOM visits, ceftriaxone treatment episodes of AOM and risk of ceftriaxone treatment if presenting to the Children’s Hospital Iceland with AOM.
Similar decreases were established in the ceftriaxone treatment episodes for pneumonia.
In the pre-vaccine period, 251 treatment episodes were recorded, compared to only 90 in the post-vaccine period.
The effect was not consistent across age-strata (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> = 72, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001).
The overall IRR was 0.37 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.47).

<p>To ascertain whether a decrease in ceftriaxone use occurred in vaccinated children for non-vaccine related indications, the incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes for all other indications was examined.
No heterogeneity across age-strata was detected (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> = 0.56, <em>P</em>=0.455).
The Mantel-Haenszel adjusted IRR was 0.96 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.06), and the null hypothesis of no difference in the incidence rate of treatment episodes could not be rejected.
The number of treatment episodes by age and vaccine period ranged from 117 to 295.

<p>To further test whether a general decrease was occurring in the overall use of ceftriaxone, rather than a specific decrease for vaccine-related indications in vaccinated children, an examination of ceftriaxone treatment episodes in all children regardless of age and indication was undertaken.
An overall decrease in the IR of ceftriaxone treatment episodes was found among children under 18 years of age regardless of indication.
The IR declined from 11.1 to 9.55 treatment episodes per 1,000 person-years, IRR 0.86 (95% CI 0.81-0.91).
The effect was not consistent across age-groups (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> = 23.6, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001).
When examined by age-group, the overall decrease proved to be driven by the youngest age-group – i.e the children who were protected by the vaccination.
The incidence of ceftriaxone treatment episodes did not decrease significantly in other age groups (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-paper1-age-group">4.8</a>).</p>

During the study period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2016, a total of 276,109 prescriptions were filled for 55,599 Icelandic children under three years of age.
From 2005-2012, first-line penicillins were the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials and represented between 41% and 47% of all antimicrobial prescriptions in this age-group.
Their use decreased suddenly to 32% in 2013, and represented only 18% of all antimicrobial prescriptions in 2014 and 2015.
During this same period, the use of second-line penicillins increased from 35%-40% from 2005-2012, to 48%, 55% and 54% in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Use of cephalosporins followed a similar trend – their use represented between 5.2% and 7.8% of all prescriptions 2005–2012, and increased to 10–15% between 2013–2016.

The model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions between each of the study’s birth-cohorts and the last vaccine non-eligible cohort, 2010.
Visually, there seemed to be a decreasing trend in hazard of prescription among the vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper3-hazard">4.15</a>).
The hazard did not change significantly between the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort and the preceding two cohorts.
It did decrease significantly thereafter, with each vaccine eligible cohort having a significantly lower hazard of outpatient antimicrobial prescription.
The estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions among children younger than three years of age was 8% (95%CI 4% to 12%).</p>

Almost all (98%) of the procedures were performed in private outpatient clinics.
The number of otolaryngologists performing outpatient TTP increased from 15 in 2005 to 23 in 2016.
Each surgeon performed a median of 123 (IQR: 56.5-196) procedures each year.

<p>In the subset of children who underwent TTP, the mean (median) number of otitis media associated visits to primary care or to the pediatric emergency department was 2.05 (2) visits in the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, compared to 1.72 (1) visits in the vaccine eligible cohorts.
The distribution in the number of previous visits was significantly different between the VNEC and VEC (Chi-Squared test statistic 63.8, P&lt;.001).
The proportion of children who did not have a single recorded visit prior to undergoing the procedure increased from 20.6% in the VNEC to 28.9% in the VEC, RR 1.40 (95%CI 1.28-1.54).
Children in the vaccine eligible cohorts had received significantly fewer antimicrobial prescriptions prior to undergoing the procedure (Chi-Squared test statistic 53.6, P&lt;.001).

<p>A diagnostic plot of Schoenfeld residuals did not reveal deviations from the proportional hazards assumption.
The hazard of undergoing TTP was considerably higher in children who had previously visited a physician for otitis media or received an antimicrobial prescription.
Children who had one prior documented visit were considerably more likely to undergo the procedure than children who had no documented visits, HR of 3.12 (95%CI 2.93 to 3.32).
Likewise, children who had previously filled one antimicrobial prescription were more likely to receive a tympanostomy tube than children who had received no prescription, 6.98 (95%CI 6.13 to 7.95).
The hazard of tympanostomy tube placement increased gradually from birth-cohort 2005 to 2015 (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper4-combined-hazard">4.20</a>).</p>

<p>Of the children in the study birth-cohorts, 550 were hospitalized 660 times with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses consistent with pneumonia.
In the same cohorts, 508 children were admitted 550 times with diagnoses consistent with other acute lower respiratory tract infections.
In the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, the crude incidence rate of pneumonia requiring hospital admission was 4.94 per 1,000 person-years, which decreased to 4.18 per 1,000 in the vaccine eligible cohorts.
The analogous crude incidence rate of hospitalizations for other acute lower respiratory tract infections was 2.94 and 5.23 per 1,000 person-years.
Though the absolute number of admissions was similar between these two groups, the distribution of cases was different.
The crude incidence rate of hospital admissions for pneumonia was highest in children 12-17 months of age, while the incidence rate of hospitalizations for other lower respiratory tract infections was highest in children &lt;6 months of age (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper5-incidence-arranged">4.21</a>).
Children admitted for other acute lower respiratory tract infections were significantly younger than children admitted for pneumonia (mean age 8.0 months and 13.6 months respectively, P&lt;.001).
Using crude age-group stratified incidence rate ratios between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts, the incidence rate of pneumonia hospitalizations was found to have decreased significantly only among children 12-17 months of age, crude incidence rate ratio 0.52 (95%CI: 0.35-0.77).
Using the same method, the incidence rate of hospital admissions for other acute lower respiratory tract infections admissions was found to have increased significantly among children 0-5 months of age, crude incidence rate ratio 1.50 (95%CI 1.23-1.84).</p>

Culture confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease was diagnosed in 37 children under three years of age in the study birth-cohorts.
Of those, 23 (59%) were admitted for inpatient treatment.
Of the admitted children, eight children had a primary discharge diagnosis of Sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (A40.3), eight were diagnosed with Pneumococcal meningitis (G00.1), two with Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (J13), two with Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) and the remaining three were diagnosed with Bacterial meningitis, unspecified (G00.9), Pyogenic arthritis, unspecified (M00.9) and Fever, unspecified (R50.9).
The crude incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, regardless of whether the child was admitted to hospital, was 24.7 per 100,000 person-years in the VNEC compared to 1.74 per 100,000 person-years in the VEC.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.1</span> Population impact on acute otitis media among children younger than 20 years of age</h3>
<p>From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015, children younger than 20 years of age visited primary care physicians 164,453 times for acute otitis media and its complications.
Strong seasonal variation was detected, with more visits occurring in December through March, and few visits occurring in June and July (Panels A and B of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-aom-arranged">4.23</a>).
The monthly number of AOM visits during the post-vaccine period was lower than average in all age-groups (Panel B of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-aom-arranged">4.23</a>).
Though visits regardless of diagnosis also decreased during the post-vaccine period (Panel C of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-aom-arranged">4.23</a>), the degree by which visits for AOM decreased was larger in magnitude.</p>

The 95% credible interval of the rate ratio was lower than one in all age-groups, indicating that there was a 97.5% or greater probability that the rate of AOM decreased due to the introduction of PHiD-CV10 in all age-groups.
The decrease was largest among young children; 16% (12%-36%) in children younger than one year of age and 18% (5%-42%) in children one year of age.

<p>The total cost of introducing PHiD-CV10 into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2015 was 2,652,364$ in constant 2015 USD.
The vaccination resulted in 13,829 (7,337 to 21,114) prevented cases of AOM among children younger than 20 years of age by 1 December 2015 (Panel C of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-aom-cum-arranged">4.26</a>).
Given the observed distribution of costs associated with each AOM visit, the direct savings resulting from vaccine-prevented cases was 1,389,900$ (95% credible interval 704,319$ to 2,201,925$).
If the vaccine was assumed to have no other benefits other than preventing AOM, and only direct costs were considered, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 91$ (95% credible interval 21$ to 259$) per prevented AOM case from the health care perspective.
The vaccine introduction prevented 10,911 days of work lost (95% credible interval 5,116 to 18,801), which translated to 194,152$ (95% credible interval 78,200$ to 364,155$) in productivity gains.
The ICER from the societal perspective was 76$ (95% credible interval 6$ to 244$) per prevented AOM case, assuming the vaccine did not result in benefits in other manifestations of pneumococcal infections.
When cost-savings due to reductions in hospital admissions for pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease were also included, the direct cost of the PHiD-CV10 introduction was -7,463,176$ (95% credible intervals -16,159,551$ to -582,135$) as of 31 December 2015.
From the health care perspective, the vaccination program was already cost-saving 7,463,176$ in the first five years of the program.
The corresponding ICER was -543$ (95% credible interval -1,508$ to -48$) per prevented AOM case.
When days of work lost due to hospitalized pneumonia and IPD cases were also included, the total cost of including PHiD-CV10 in the pediatric vaccination program was -8,164,894$ (95% credible interval -17,197,959$ to -1,004,553$) as of 31 December 2015.
The corresponding ICER was -594$ (95% credible interval -1,597$ to -76$) per AOM case prevented.</p>

<p>The rate ratios between the observed and predicted number of pneumonia hospitalizations are shown in Table <a href="results.html#tab:table-paper6-pneumonia-results-summary">4.25</a>.
Among children zero to four years of age, the posterior median of the rate ratio was 0.67, and the 2.5% credidble limit was 0.51.
This was consistent with a 2.5% probability that the rate ratio was lower than 0.51 and a 47.5% probability that the rate ratio layed between 0.51 and 0.67.
Though the 97.5% credible limit was above the threshold value of one, there was a 94% probability that the rate ratio was lower than one, and a 90% probability that it was lower than 0.83.
Simlarly the posterior median of the rate ratio was 0.74 among children five to 19 years of age, and there was a 90% probability that the rate ratio was lower than one.
Among adults 65 to 79 years of age, and 80 years of age and older, the posterior median of the rate ratio was 0.75 and 0.76 respectively, and both had a 97% probability of being lower than one.</p>
<p>A 12-month rolling rate ratio between the observed and predicted number pneumonia hospitalizations is presented in Panel A of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-pneumonia-cum-arranged">4.30</a>.
Visually, the rate of pneumonia hospitalizations among children zero to four years of age seems to begin to decline in January 2012 (the first rolling 12-month period to include only post-vaccine months), and hospitalizations among adults 65 years of age and older seems to begin to decline in January 2014.</p>

<p>The total cost of introducing PHiD-CV10 into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2017 was 3,451,805$ at constant 2015 USD.
In total, the introduction of PHiD-CV10 resulted in 1,844 (589 to 3,239) prevented pneumonia hospitalizations in the Icelandic population by 1 December 2017 (Panel C of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-pneumonia-cum-arranged">4.30</a>).
Given the observed distribution of costs associated with each pneumonia hospitalization, the direct savings resulting from vaccine-prevented hospitalizations was 13,330,902$ (95% credible interval 2,933,955$ to 26,270,332$), in constant 2015 USD.
If the vaccine is assumed to have no other benefits than preventing pneumonia hospitalizations, and only the direct costs are considered, the ICER was -5,315$ (95% credible interval -8,877$ to 711$) per prevented pneumonia hospitalization, indicating a net savings of 5,315$ for each prevented hospitalization from the health care perspective.
The vaccination program prevented 29,969 days of work lost (95% credible interval 9,964 to 52,900), which translated to 838,952$ (95% credible interval 273,559$ to 1,493,478$) in productivity gains.
From the societal perspective, the ICER was -5,794$ (95% credible interval -9,275$ to 24$) per prevented pneumonia hospitalization, assuming no other vaccine benefit, which implies that the society gains 5,794$ in constant 2015 USD for every pneumonia hospitalization prevented by investing in PHiD-CV10.
If the vaccination program’s effects on the other manifestations of pneumococcal disease were included, then the ICER was -5,640$ (95% credible interval -10,336$ to -1,032$) in constant 2015 USD from the health care perspective as of 31 December 2015.
Addtionally including loss of work resulted in an ICER of -7,440$ (95% credible interval -13,701$ to -1,175$).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.3</span> Population impact on hospital admissions for invasive pneumococcal disease</h3>
<p>From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2016, 338 hospitalizations for culture confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease were recorded.
Of those, 206 occurred before the introduction of PHiD-CV10 into the pediatric vaccination program in Iceland.
Hospital admissions due to vaccine-type IPD were 175, of which 138 occurred prior to vaccine introduction.
Only two vaccine-type IPD hospitalizations of children zero to four years of age were recorded in the post-vaccine period.
Both cases were unvaccinated and both occurred in 2011.
This is compared to 32 hospital admissions of the same age-group in the pre-vaccine period.
The number of vaccine-type IPD cases were not sufficiently many to perform a time series analysis.</p>
<p>Standardized hospitalizations for IPD decreased among children zero to four years of age, while standardized hospital admissions regardless of cause did not decrease to the same extent (Panels B and C of Figure @ref(fig:figure-results-paper6-ipd_arranged)).
Discrepancies between hospital admissions for IPD and all-cause hospitalizations were also noted in the other age-groups.
Hospitalizations for IPD among individuals five to 64 years of age decreased while all-cause hospitalizations remained stable.
While hospital admissions for IPD among adults 65 years of age and older did not change visibly, the standardized all-cause hospitalizations increased, suggesting a relative decline in IPD admissions.</p>

<p>The stacked model for children zero to four years of age was comprised of the synthetic control model weighted at 0.001 and ITS with offset weighted at 0.999.
For individuals five to 64 years of age, and adults 65 years of age and older, the LOOCV procedure assigned full weight to the synthetic control model, excluding contributions from the other three.</p>
<p>The posterior prediction of IPD hospitalizations and 95% credible intervals are are shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-ipd-stacked-models">4.33</a>.
Among children zero to four years of age, observed IPD hospitalizations were equal to or fewer than the predicted hospitalizations in all but two quarters.
Similary, observed hospitalizations among indvidiuals five to 64 years of age were fewer than predicted more often than expected.
Both suggest that the vaccine prevented cases from occurring.</p>

<p>The rate ratios between the observed and predicted number of IPD hospitalizations in the post-vaccine period are shown in Table <a href="results.html#tab:table-paper6-ipd-results-summary">4.26</a>.
The posterior median of the rate ratio for children younger than five years of age was 0.27, corresponding to a 50% probability that the vaccine impact was greater than or equal to 73%.
The 95% credible intervals of the rate ratio were wide, reflecting the uncertainty due to the few number of IPD hospitalizations.
However, 90% of the MCMC draws of the rate ratio were below 0.75 and 93% were under the threshold value of one.
The 95% credible interval of the rate ratio among individuals five to 64 years of age was lower than one, indicating a 97.5% or greater probability that the rate of IPD hospitalization decreased in this age-group following the introduction of PHiD-CV10.</p>
<p>The 12-month rolling rate ratio is presented in Panel A of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-ipd-cum-arranged">4.34</a>.
The rolling rate ratio for children zero to four years of age was unstable due to numerical issues with both the numerator and the denominator.
In some 12-month periods, no IPD hospitalizations were observed and the resulting rate ratio was zero regardless of the denominator.
In other periods, 2.5% or more of the MCMC draws predicted zero IPD hospitalizations, which resulted in a 95% credible intervals of the rate ratio that extended towards infinity.
These issues do not change the overall interpretation of the prediction line presented in Panel A of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-ipd-cum-arranged">4.34</a> or the rate ratios presented in <a href="results.html#tab:table-paper6-aom-results-summary">4.24</a>.</p>

<p>In total, by December 2016, the introduction of PHiD-CV10 prevented 57 (10 to 127) cases of IPD serious enough to warrant hospital admission (Panel C of Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper6-ipd-cum-arranged">4.34</a>).
The total cost of introducing PHiD-CV10 into the Icelandic pediatric vaccination program from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2016 was 3,097,861$, in constant 2015 USD.
Given the observed distribution of costs associated with each IPD hospitalization, the direct savings resulting from vaccine-prevented hospitalizations of IPD was 673,008$ (95% credible intervals -189,654$ to 2,081,594$).
If the vaccine was assumed to have no other benefits than preventing IPD hospitalizations, and only the direct costs are considered, the ICER was 30,134$ (95% credible interval 8,488$ to 80,375$) per prevented IPD hospitalization.
The vaccine introduction prevented 1,280 days of work lost (444 to 2,410) due to IPD, which translated to 35,280$ (95% credible intervals 9,437$ to 70,609$) in productivity gains.
If the vaccine was assumed to have no other benefits than preventing IPD hospitalizations, the ICER from the societal perspective was 30,134$ (95% credible intervals 8,487$ to 80,375$) per prevented IPD hospitalization.
When cost-savings due to reductions in AOM visits or hospital admissions for pneumonia were also included, the ICER was -119,992$ (95% credible interval -387,183$ to -9,542$) per prevented IPD hospitalization from the health care perspective.
When days of work lost were also considered, the ICER was -130,791$ (95% credible interval -416,004$ to -15,860$) per prevented IPD hospitalization.</p>
