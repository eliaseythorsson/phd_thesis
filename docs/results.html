<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Data collection and sources</h2>
<p>The data presented in this thesis were collected and analysed over a four year period from 2013-2017. Consequently, the papers that form this thesis were written and published at different times. Therefore, the study period and the populations described in each paper varies slightly. They differ however only marginally from the final data summary described below. The results of papers I-VI are summarized in their respective sub-chapters.</p>
<p>When data from all registries were taken together, individual-level information was available for 375,383 Icelandic citizens, of which 183,544 were female and 181,316 were male. Gender was not registered for 10,523 individuals. The exact date of birth was available for 366,188 and birth-year was registered for the rest. The median birth-year for the whole study population was 1979 (IQR 1958-1997). Death was registered for 12,308 individuals during the study period.</p>
<p>The study often examined the data stratified by birth-cohort. The number of children in each birth-cohort who contributed data to the present study are shown in Table <a href="results.html#tab:table-cohort-results">4.1</a>.</p>

The number of children in each cohort who had registered immigration or emigration from Iceland before four years of age is shown.</caption>

<p>To further test whether a general decrease was occurring in the overall use of ceftriaxone, rather than a specific decrease for vaccine-related indications in vaccinated children, an examination of ceftriaxone treatment episodes in all children regardless of age and indication was undertaken. An overall decrease in the IR of ceftriaxone treatment episodes was found among children under 18 years of age regardless of indication. The IR declined from 11.1 to 9.55 treatment episodes per 1,000 person-years, IRR 0.86 (95% CI 0.81-0.91). The effect was not consistent across age-groups (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> = 23.6, <em>P</em>&lt;0.001). When examined by age-group, the overall decrease proved to be driven by the youngest age-group – i.e the children who were protected by the vaccination.

<p>The lowest incidence was observed in children zero to three months of age, ranging from 3-6 visits per 100 person-years. Thereafter, the incidence increased sharply, and peaked in children eight to eleven and twelve to fifteen months of age, ranging from 50 to 80 visits per 100 person-years. The crude IR decreased significantly in all age-groups, with incidence rate ratios ranging from 0.60 to 0.94. The largest and visually most consistent decrease in incidence was observed among children zero to three months of age, IRR 0.6 (95%CI 0.51 to 0.69), Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper2-incidence">4.9</a>.</p>

No systematic deviations in Schoenfeld residuals were detected on diagnostic plots indicating that the proportional hazard assumption for each covariate were met. There was little variation in the hazard of AOM between vaccine non-eligible birth-cohorts. Only the 2007 birth-cohort differed significantly, with a hazard ratio of 1.06 (95%CI 1.01 to 1.12) compared to the 2010 birth-cohort. An abrupt and significant decrease in the hazard of AOM was noted in the first vaccine eligible cohort, which continued for all remaining VEC (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper2-hazard">4.10</a>). The estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 on AOM episodes in the primary care setting among children younger than three years of age was 21% (95%CI 11% to 30%).</p>

<p>From 2005-2012, first-line penicillins were the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials and represented between 41% and 47% of all antimicrobial prescriptions in children younger than three years of age. Their use decreased suddenly to 32% in 2013, and represented only 18% of all antimicrobial prescriptions in 2014 and 2015. During this same period, the use of second-line penicillins increased from 35%-40% from 2005-2012, to 48%, 55% and 54% in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Use of cephalosporins followed a similar trend – there use represented between 5.2% and 7.8% of all prescriptions 2005–2012, and increased to 10–15% between 2013–2016.

The hazard did not change significantly between the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort and the preceding two cohorts, but did decrease significantly thereafter, with each vaccine eligible cohort having a significantly lower hazard of outpatient antimicrobial prescription. The estimated impact of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions among children younger than three years of age was 8% (95%CI 4% to 12%).</p>

<p>Demographic data regarding the study birth-cohorts are summarized in chapter <a href="results.html#datasourcesresults">4.1</a>. In total, during the study period, 14,351 children underwent 20,373 tympanostomy tube placements, 57% of whom were male. The median age of children undergoing their first tympanostomy procedure was 17 months (IQR 13-24). In the subset of children who underwent a TTP during the study period, 10,248 (71%) underwent only one procedure, 2,902 (20%) underwent two, and 1201 (8%) underwent three or more. Almost all (98%) of the procedures were performed in private outpatient clinics. The number of otolaryngologists performing outpatient TTP increased from 15 in 2005 to 23 in 2016. Each surgeon performed a median of 123 (IQR: 56.5-196) procedures each year. The study’s population is summarized in Table <a href="results.html#tab:table-paper4-demographics">4.17</a>.</p>

<p>A diagnostic plot of Schoenfeld residuals did not reveal deviations from the proportional hazards assumption. The hazard of undergoing TTP was considerably higher in children who had previously visited a physician for otitis media or received an antimicrobial prescription. Children who had one prior documented visit were considerably more likely to undergo the procedure than children who had no documented visits, HR of 3.12 (95%CI 2.93 to 3.32). Likewise, children who had previously filled one antimicrobial prescription were more likely to receive a tympanostomy tube than children who had received no prescription, 6.98 (95%CI 6.13 to 7.95). The hazard of tympanostomy tube placement increased gradually from birth-cohort 2005 to 2015 (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper4-combined-hazard">4.20</a>).</p>

Figure 4.20: The hazard ratio (HR) of tympanostomy tube placements (TTP) is depicted between each birth-cohort and the last vaccine non-eligible birth-cohort are depicted, as estimated by three Cox regression models. In panel A, the unadjusted HR estimates are shown. Panel B shows HR estimates adjusted for antimicrobial prescriptions, and panel C illustrates the HR estimates adjusted for otitis media associated visits. Primary care visits are obtained from the Primary Care Registry of the Directorate of Health, and the observation period is restricted to December 2015. Because of this the data presented in panel C is restricted to birth-cohorts 2005-2014. The figure demonstrates an increasing hazard of TTP with each successive birth-cohort. The effect is more pronounced when adjustment is made for antimicrobial prescriptions and visits.

<p>Of the children in the study birth-cohorts, 550 were hospitalized 660 times with ICD-10 discharge diagnoses consistent with pneumonia. In the same cohorts, 508 children were admitted 550 times with diagnoses consistent with acute lower respiratory tract infections. In the vaccine non-eligible cohorts, the crude incidence rate of pneumonia requiring hospital admission was 4.94 per 1,000 person-years, which decreased to 4.18 per 1,000 in the vaccine eligible cohorts. The analogous crude incidence rate of hospitalizations for acute lower respiratory tract infections was 2.94 and 5.23 per 1,00 person-years. Though the absolute number of admissions was similar between these two groups, the distribution of cases was different. The crude incidence rate of hospital admissions for pneumonia was highest in children 12-17 months of age, while the incidence rate of hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract infections was highest in children &lt;6 months of age (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper5-incidence-arranged">4.21</a>). Children admitted for acute lower respiratory tract infections were significantly younger than children admitted for pneumonia (mean age 8.0 months and 13.6 months respectively, P&lt;.001). Using crude age-group stratified incidence rate ratios between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts, the incidence rate of pneumonia hospitalizations was found to have decreased significantly only among children 12-17 months of age, crude incidence rate ratio 0.52 (95%CI: 0.35-0.77). Using the same method, the incidence rate of hospital admissions for acute lower respiratory tract infections admissions was found to have increased significantly among children 0-5 months of age, crude incidence rate ratio 1.50 (95%CI 1.23-1.84).</p>

<p>A significant difference was detected in the cumulative rate of hospital admissions for both pneumonia and acute lower respiratory tract infections between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper5-kmplot">4.22</a>). The hazard ratio of hospital admission for pneumonia was 0.80 (95%CI:0.67-0.95), with an E-value of 1.81 and a lower bound of 1.29. When the risk-set was restricted to children younger than 90 days and 90 days and older, respectively, the hazard ratio was 1.22 (95%CI 0.81-1.85) and 0.73 (95%CI 0.60-0.89) respectively. The hazard ratio for hospital admission due to acute lower respiratory tract infection was 1.32 (95%CI:1.14-1.53), with an E-value of 1.97 and a lower bound of 1.54. The hazard ratio was augmented when children younger than 90 days were analysed separately, HR 1.54 (95%CI 1.23-1.94). It was not significant in children 90 days and older, HR 1.18 (95%CI 0.97-1.44).</p>
<p>A total of 131 hospitalizations for acute upper respiratory tract infections were recorded for 123 children. During the same period, 256 children were admitted to hospital 280 times for otitis media and complications. The crude incidence rate of hospital admissions for otitis media was higher than the incidence rate of admissions for acute upper respiratory tract infections; 2.32 and 1.45 per 1,000 person-years in the vaccine eligible and vaccine non-eligible cohorts respectively, compared to 0.78 and 1.13 per 1,000 person-years. The mean age of children admitted for acute upper respiratory tract infections was 13.5 months compared to 12.8 months for children admitted for otitis media and complications. The crude incidence rate by age-group is shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper5-incidence-arranged">4.21</a>. The cumulative incidence rate of hospitalization per 1000 person-years for acute upper respiratory tract infections and otitis media and complications are shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper5-kmplot">4.22</a>. The hazard ratio of otitis media hospitalizations between the vaccine eligible and non-eligible cohorts was 0.57 (95%CI:0.43-0.73) with an E-value of 2.9 .and a lower bound of 2.08. When restricted to children younger than 90 days of age, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.33-1.57), and when evaluating children 90 days and older it was 0.55 (95%CI 0.42-0.72). The hazard ratio for hospital admission for acute upper respiratory tract infections was 1.56 (95%CI:1.11-2.19), with an E-value of 2.49 and a lower bound of 1.46. Among children younger than 90 days, and 90 days and older respectively, the hazard ratio was 3.4 (95%CI 1.72-6.90) and 1.13 (95%CI 0.75-1.71).</p>

<p>A total of 15 children were admitted to hospital 19 times for meningitis, and 61 children were admitted 63 times for sepsis. The crude incidence rate of meningitis hospitalization was 16.5 and 8.7 per 100,000 person-years in the vaccine non-eligible and vaccine eligible cohorts respectively, and the analogous crude incidence rate for sepsis hospitalizations was 38.8 and 52.3. Culture confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease was diagnosed in 37 children under three years of age in the study birth-cohorts. Of those, 23 (59%) were admitted for inpatient treatment. Of the admitted children, eight children had a primary discharge diagnosis of Sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (A40.3), eight were diagnosed with Pneumococcal meningitis (G00.1), two with Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (J13), two with Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified (J15) and the remaining three were diagnosed with Bacterial meningitis, unspecified (G00.9), Pyogenic arthritis, unspecified (M00.9) and Fever, unspecified (R50.9). The crude incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, regardless of whether the child was admitted to hospital, was 24.7 per 100,000 person-years in the VNEC compared to 1.74 per 100,000 person-years in the VEC. When only considering hospitalized invasive pneumococcal disease, the crude IR was 24.7 and 1.74 per 100,000 person-years. No vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease was diagnosed in the VEC. Crude incidence rates of hospitalization by age-group are shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:figure-results-paper5-incidence-arranged">4.21</a>.</p>
