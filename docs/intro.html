<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is a commensal bacterium found in the nasopharynx of humans where it plays an integral part in the normal upper respiratory flora. It is also a common pathogen and is one of the most common bacterial causes of disease in humans. In classical medical texts pneumococcus is described as a Gram-positive lancet-shaped coccus that is usually found in pairs. It was first described by two microbiologist in 1881, George M. Sternberg and Loius Pasteur. <span class="citation">(Pasteur <a href="#ref-Pasteur1881">1881</a>, <span class="citation">Sternberg (<a href="#ref-Sternberg1881">1881</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Watson et al. (<a href="#ref-Watson1993">1993</a>)</span>)</span> Pneumococcus is encapsulated by a polysaccharide coating that protects it from environmental factors. The polysaccharide capsule acts as an invisibility cloak in regard to the human immune system which is rendered unable to detect pneumococcus except through certain patterns in the oligosaccharides contained within the capsule. Based on these patterns, pneumococcus has been classified into over 90 different serotypes as of the writing of this thesis. Additionally, as the capsule only contains polysaccharides and not proteins, the immune response is T cell independent and therefore poorly immunogenic even after identification by the immune system. These are the fundamental problems faced by scientists when engineering new pneumococcal vaccines.</p>
<p>All serotypes of pneumococcus have the potential to cause disease in humans. However, some are more virulent than others. The prevalence of asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx varies greatly by serotype as does the prevalence of serotypes causing clinical infections. Quantifying the pathogenic potential of serotypes can be difficult as both need to be considered. With few exemptions, acquisition of a new serotype into the nasopharyngeal flora proceeds clinical disease caused by that serotype. Pneumococcal epidemiology is dominated by this effect, wherein children act as a reservoir of asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage from which other children and adults acquire serotypes that may lead to symptomatic disease. Vaccinations that decrease the pneumococcal carriage in children do therefore have the potential to reduce the incidence of disease in both other unvaccinated children and adults. This phenomenon is called a herd-effect and is integral to the development of vaccination strategies to combat pneumococcal disease.</p>
<p>The infectious manifestations of pneumococcal disease are broadly speaking local infections of the respiratory tract and infections of previously sterile sites. They range from common to uncommon and from benign to serious. The most common infectious manifestation of pneumococcus in acute otitis media (AOM) – an infection of the middle ear. AOM is the most common reason for physician visit and antimicrobial prescription in the pediatric population. However, the disease course is benign and rarely results in permanent disability. The pathogenesis of AOM is complex and can both be caused by viral and bacterial pathogens. Bacterial AOM is most often caused by pneumococcus and Haemophilus influnzae. Acute sinusitis is another common but benign manifestation of pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcus is also a common cause of pneumonia – from which it gets its name. Pneumonia often requires hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial treatment and can uncommonly lead to permanent disability and death. Finally, if pneumococcus gains access to normally sterile sites it may cause invasive infections. This includes bacteremia - an infection of the blood, and meningitis – an infection of the meninges. These infectious manifestations are grouped together as invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Whilst IPD is extremely uncommon the consequences can be disastrous. The case fatality ratio from pneumococcal meningitis in Iceland is estimated at 15.3%.</p>
<p>Pneumococcus became an early target for vaccine development because of this broad range of disease caused by pneumococcus</p>
<p>The vaccine benefit can be quantified in two different ways. On one hand it can prevent uncommon but serious manifestations of disease and has the potential to prevent death and serious disability. On the other hand, it prevents common infections that cumulatively present a large healthcare burden due to frequent physician visits, antimicrobial prescriptions and days of work lost by parents and caregivers.</p>
