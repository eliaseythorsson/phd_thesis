<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is a commensal bacterium found in the nasopharynx of humans where it plays an integral role in the normal upper respiratory flora. It is also a common pathogen and is one of the most common bacterial causes of disease in humans. In classical medical texts pneumococcus is described as a Gram-positive lancet-shaped coccus that is usually found in pairs. In fact, pneumococcus is <em>the</em> Gram-positive coccus, in that it was the first bacteria that Christian Gram noted to retain the dark aniline-gentian violet stain that now bears his name <span class="citation">(Gram <a href="#ref-Gram1884">1884</a>)</span>. Pneumococcus was first isolated in 1881 by two microbiologist, George M. Sternberg in the United States and Loius Pasteur in France <span class="citation">(Pasteur <a href="#ref-Pasteur1881">1881</a>; Sternberg <a href="#ref-Sternberg1881">1882</a>; Watson et al. <a href="#ref-Watson1993">1993</a>)</span>. In both cases the sample from which the bacterium was isolated originated from healthy carriers, rather than ill patients. The causal association between this newly discovered bacterium and pneumonia was firmly established only five years later <span class="citation">(Weichselbaum <a href="#ref-Weichselbaum1886">1886</a>)</span>, and in the following decade, all clinical presentations of pneumococcal infection had been described <span class="citation">(Austrian <a href="#ref-Austrian1981">1981</a>)</span>. Pneumococcus has gone by many names from its first isolation in 1881. Originally named <em>Micrococcus pasteuri</em> by Sternberg <span class="citation">(Sternberg <a href="#ref-Sternberg1881">1882</a>)</span>, a scientific consensus was reached in 1920 whereupon it was agreed that the official name should be <em>Diplococcus pneumoniae</em> <span class="citation">(Winslow et al. <a href="#ref-Winslow1920">1920</a>)</span>. It was not until 1974 when pneumococcus received its current name, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> <span class="citation">(Deibel and Seeley <a href="#ref-Deibel1974">1974</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Pneumococcus is encapsulated by a polysaccharide coating that protects it from environmental factors. The polysaccharide capsule acts as an invisibility cloak in regard to the human immune system which is rendered unable to detect pneumococcus except through certain patterns in the oligosaccharides contained within the capsule <span class="citation">(Tuomanen, Austrian, and Masure <a href="#ref-Epstein1995">1995</a>)</span>. Based on these patterns, pneumococcus has been classified into over 97 different serotypes as of the writing of this thesis. Additionally, as the capsule only contains polysaccharides and not proteins, the immune response is T cell independent and therefore poorly immunogenic even after identification by the immune system <span class="citation">(Geno et al. <a href="#ref-Geno2015b">2015</a>)</span>. These are the fundamental problems faced by scientists when engineering new pneumococcal vaccines. The significance of serotypes on the development of vaccines should not be understated. Lack of knowledge about serotype-specific immunogenicity was the main reason for the failure of the original attempts at preventing pneumococcal pneumonia by Wright in South Africa <span class="citation">(Wright et al. <a href="#ref-Wright1914">1914</a>)</span>. Because of this, the feasibility of pneumococcal vaccination wasn’t definitively demonstrated until 1945 <span class="citation">(Macleod et al. <a href="#ref-Macleod1945">1945</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>All serotypes of pneumococcus have the potential to cause disease in humans. However, some are more virulent than others. The prevalence of asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx varies greatly by serotype as does the prevalence of serotypes causing clinical infections. Quantifying the pathogenic potential of serotypes can be difficult as both need to be considered. With few exemptions, acquisition of a new serotype into the nasopharyngeal flora proceeds clinical disease caused by that serotype. Pneumococcal epidemiology is dominated by this effect, wherein children act as a reservoir of asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage from which other children and adults acquire serotypes that may lead to symptomatic disease. Vaccinations that decrease the pneumococcal carriage in children do therefore have the potential to reduce the incidence of disease in both other unvaccinated children and adults. This phenomenon is called a herd-effect and is integral to the development of vaccination strategies to combat pneumococcal disease.</p>
<p>The infectious manifestations of pneumococcal disease are broadly speaking local infections of the respiratory tract and infections of previously sterile sites. They range from common to uncommon and from benign to serious. The most common infectious manifestation of pneumococcus in acute otitis media (AOM) – an infection of the middle ear. AOM is the most common reason for physician visit and antimicrobial prescription in the pediatric population. However, the disease course is benign and rarely results in permanent disability. The pathogenesis of AOM is complex and can both be caused by viral and bacterial pathogens. Bacterial AOM is most often caused by pneumococcus and Haemophilus influnzae. Acute sinusitis is another common but benign manifestation of pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcus is also a common cause of pneumonia – from which it gets its name. Pneumonia often requires hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial treatment and can uncommonly lead to permanent disability and death. Finally, if pneumococcus gains access to normally sterile sites it may cause invasive infections. This includes bacteremia - an infection of the blood, and meningitis – an infection of the meninges. These infectious manifestations are grouped together as invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Whilst IPD is extremely uncommon the consequences can be disastrous. The case fatality ratio from pneumococcal meningitis in Iceland is estimated at 15.3%.</p>
<p>Pneumococcus became an early target for vaccine development because of this broad range of disease caused by pneumococcus</p>
<p>The vaccine benefit can be quantified in two different ways. On one hand it can prevent uncommon but serious manifestations of disease and has the potential to prevent death and serious disability. On the other hand, it prevents common infections that cumulatively present a large healthcare burden due to frequent physician visits, antimicrobial prescriptions and days of work lost by parents and caregivers.</p>
<div id="clinical-manifestations-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Clinical manifestations of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></h2>
<p>~ 2 pages - Build transmission dynamics, carriage and disease mentioned in introduction - Short overview of mechanism by which individuals become colonized - Asymptomatic carriage the predecessor of infections - Non-invasive vs. invasive infections - Explain relevance of differentiating the two - list manifestations in each category building on introduction - Explain that vaccines have variable impact on different manifestations - Use examples from the two large RCTs</p>
<p>The relationship between pneumococcus and humans is complex. Most children are colonized by pneumococcus within the first months of life. The serotype distribution of the initial colonization is influenced by the distribution of serotypes within the family. Over the course of the child’s lifetime, they will be colonized by many different serotypes. The child’s immune system will learn to recognize the serotype and will either clear the colonization or maintain a equilibrium in which the serotype is kept within a certain limit of reproduction. Consequently, the contribution of pneumococcus to the human upper respiratory flora is in a state of constant flux. New serotypes enter while old exit, and the relative density of serotypes changes. In some cases the equilibrium between pneumococcus and the host is destabilized resulting in rapid growth of pneumococcus which results in clinical manifestations. This most commonly occurs in the upper respiratory tract where pneumococcus is generally located. This results in the common clinical manifestations of pneumococcal infections, i.e. AOM, acute sinusitis and conjunctivitis. The pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia is thought to occur through micro-aspiration of upper respiratory secretions with subsequent rapid proliferation of pneumococcus in the lower respiratory tract. Invasive disease occurs when pneumococcus penetrates the host immunological defenses and proliferates in normally sterile tissue.</p>
